    <p>
        WAKE! For the Sun behind yon Eastern height <br/>
        Has chased the Session of the Stars from Night;<br/>
        And to the field of Heav’n ascending, strikes<br/>
        The Sulta´n’s Turret with a Shaft of Light.
    </p>
    <h2>II</h2>
    <p>
        Before the phantom of False morning died,<br/>
        Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,<br/>
        “When all the Temple is prepared within,<br/>
        Why lags the drowsy Worshipper outside?”
    </p>
    <h2>III</h2>
    <p>
        And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br/>
        The Tavern shouted—“Open then the Door!<br/>
        You know how little while we have to stay,<br/>
        And, once departed, may return no more.”
    </p>
    <h2>IV</h2>
    <p>
        Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br/>
        The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br/>
        Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough<br/>
        Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.
    </p>
    <h2>V</h2>
    <p>
        Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose,<br/>
        And Jamshy´d’s Sev’n-ring’d Cup where no one knows;<br/>
        But still a Ruby gushes from the Vine,<br/>
        And many a Garden by the Water blows.
    </p>
    <h2>VI</h2>
    <p>
        And David’s lips are lockt; but in divine<br/>
        High-piping Pe´hlevi, with “Wine! Wine! Wine!<br/>
        Red Wine!”—the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br/>
        That sallow cheek of hers to incarnadine.
    </p>
    <h2>VII</h2>
    <p>
        Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br/>
        Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling:<br/>
        The Bird of Time has but a little way<br/>
        To flutter—and the Bird is on the Wing.
    </p>
    <h2>VIII</h2>
    <p>
        Whether at Naisha´pu´r or Babylon,<br/>
        Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,<br/>
        The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,<br/>
        The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.
    </p>
    <h2>IX</h2>
    <p>
        Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say;<br/>
        Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?<br/>
        And this first Summer month that brings the Rose<br/>
        Shall take Jamshy´d and Kaikoba´d away.
    </p>
    <h2>X</h2>
    <p>
        Well, let it take them! What have we to do<br/>
        With Kaikoba´d the Great, or Kaikhosru´?<br/>
        Let Rustum cry “To Battle!” as he likes,<br/>
        Or Ha´tim Tai “To supper!”—heed not you.
    </p>
    <h2>XI</h2>
    <p>
        With me along the strip of Herbage strown<br/>
        That just divides the desert from the sown,<br/>
        Where name of Slave and Sulta´n is forgot—<br/>
        And Peace to Ma´hmu´d on his golden Throne!
    </p>
    <h2>XII</h2>
    <p>
        Here with a little Bread beneath the Bough,<br/>
        A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse—and Thou<br/>
        Beside me singing in the Wilderness—<br/>
        Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!
    </p>
    <h2>XIII</h2>
    <p>
        Some for the Glories of This World; and some<br/>
        Sigh for the Prophet’s Paradise to come;<br/>
        Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,<br/>
        Nor heed the music of a distant Drum!
    </p>
    <h2>XIV</h2>
    <p>
        Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spin<br/>
        The Thread of present Life away to win—<br/>
        What? for ourselves, who know not if we shall<br/>
        Breathe out the very Breath we now breathe in!
    </p>
    <h2>XV</h2>
    <p>
        Look to the blowing Rose about us—“Lo,<br/>
        Laughing,” she says, “into the world I blow,<br/>
        At once the silken tassel of my Purse<br/>
        Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.”
    </p>
    <h2>XVI</h2>
    <p>
        For those who husbanded the Golden grain,<br/>
        And those who flung it to the winds like Rain,<br/>
        Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn’d<br/>
        As, buried once, Men want dug up again.
    </p>
    <h2>XVII</h2>
    <p>
        The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br/>
        Turns Ashes—or it prospers; and anon,<br/>
        Like Snow upon the Desert’s dusty Face,<br/>
        Lighting a little hour or two—was gone.
    </p>
    <h2>XVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Think, in this batter’d Caravanserai<br/>
        Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day,<br/>
        How Sulta´n after Sulta´n with his Pomp<br/>
        Abode his destined Hour, and went his way.
    </p>
    <h2>XIX</h2>
    <p>
        They say the Lion and the Lizard keep<br/>
        The Courts where Jamshy´d gloried and drank deep:<br/>
        And Bahra´m, that great Hunter—the Wild Ass<br/>
        Stamps o’er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep.
    </p>
    <h2>XX</h2>
    <p>
        The Palace that to Heav’n his pillars threw,<br/>
        And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew—<br/>
        I saw the solitary Ringdove there,<br/>
        And “Coo, coo, coo,” she cried; and “Coo, coo, coo.”
    </p>
    <h2>XXI</h2>
    <p>
        Ah, my Belove´d, fill the Cup that clears<br/>
        TO-DAY of past Regret and Future Fears:<br/>
        To-morrow!—Why, To-morrow I may be<br/>
        Myself with Yesterday’s Sev’n thousand Years.
    </p>
    <h2>XXII</h2>
    <p>
        For some we loved, the loveliest and the best<br/>
        That from his Vintage rolling Time has prest,<br/>
        Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,<br/>
        And one by one crept silently to rest.
    </p>
    <h2>XXIII</h2>
    <p>
        And we, that now make merry in the Room<br/>
        They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom,<br/>
        Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth<br/>
        Descend—ourselves to make a Couch—for whom?
    </p>
    <h2>XXIV</h2>
    <p>
        I sometimes think that never blows so red<br/>
        The Rose as where some buried Cæsar bled;<br/>
        That every Hyacinth the Garden wears<br/>
        Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.
    </p>
    <h2>XXV</h2>
    <p>
        And this delightful Herb whose living Green<br/>
        Fledges the River’s Lip on which we lean—<br/>
        Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows<br/>
        From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!
    </p>
    <h2>XXVI</h2>
    <p>
        Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,<br/>
        Before we too into the Dust descend;<br/>
        Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie<br/>
        Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and—sans End!
    </p>
    <h2>XXVII</h2>
    <p>
        Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,<br/>
        And those that after some TO-MORROW stare,<br/>
        A Muezzi´n from the Tower of Darkness cries,<br/>
        “Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There!”
    </p>
    <h2>XXVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Another Voice, when I am sleeping, cries,<br/>
        “The Flower should open with the Morning skies.”<br/>
        And a retreating Whisper, as I wake—<br/>
        “The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.”
    </p>
    <h2>XXIX</h2>
    <p>
        Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss’d<br/>
        Of the Two Worlds so learnedly are thrust<br/>
        Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br/>
        Are scatter’d, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.
    </p>
    <h2>XXX</h2>
    <p>
        Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br/>
        Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br/>
        About it and about: but evermore<br/>
        Came out by the same door as in I went.
    </p>
    <h2>XXXI</h2>
    <p>
        With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br/>
        And with my own hand wrought to make it grow;<br/>
        And this was all the Harvest that I reap’d—<br/>
        “I came like Water, and like Wind I go.”
    </p>
    <h2>XXXII</h2>
    <p>
        Into this Universe, and Why not knowing<br/>
        Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;<br/>
        And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br/>
        I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.
    </p>
    <h2>XXXIII</h2>
    <p>
        What, without asking, hither hurried Whence?<br/>
        And, without asking, Whither hurried hence!<br/>
        Ah, contrite Heav’n endowed us with the Vine<br/>
        To drug the memory of that insolence!
    </p>
    <h2>XXXIV</h2>
    <p>
        Up from Earth’s Centre through the Seventh Gate<br/>
        I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate;<br/>
        And many Knots unravel’d by the Road;<br/>
        But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.
    </p>
    <h2>XXXV</h2>
    <p>
        There was the Door to which I found no Key:<br/>
        There was the Veil through which I could not see:<br/>
        Some little talk awhile of ME and THEE<br/>
        There was—and then no more of THEE and ME.
    </p>
    <h2>XXXVI</h2>
    <p>
        Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mourn<br/>
        In flowing Purple, of their Lord forlorn;<br/>
        Nor Heaven, with those eternal Signs reveal’d<br/>
        And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn.
    </p>
    <h2>XXXVII</h2>
    <p>
        Then of the THEE IN ME who works behind<br/>
        The Veil of Universe I cried to find<br/>
        A Lamp to guide me through the Darkness; and<br/>
        Something then said—“An Understanding blind.”
    </p>
    <h2>XXXVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn<br/>
        I lean’d, the secret Well of Life to learn:<br/>
        And Lip to Lip it murmur’d—“While you live,<br/>
        Drink!—for, once dead, you never shall return.”
    </p>
    <h2>XXXIX</h2>
    <p>
        I think the Vessel, that with fugitive<br/>
        Articulation answer’d, once did live,<br/>
        And drink; and that impassive Lip I kiss’d,<br/>
        How many Kisses might it take—and give!
    </p>
    <h2>XL</h2>
    <p>
        For I remember stopping by the way<br/>
        To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay:<br/>
        And with its all-obliterated Tongue<br/>
        It murmur’d—“Gently, Brother, gently, pray!”
    </p>
    <h2>XLI</h2>
    <p>
        For has not such a Story from of Old<br/>
        Down Man’s successive generations roll’d<br/>
        Of such a clod of saturated Earth<br/>
        Cast by the Maker into Human mould?
    </p>
    <h2>XLII</h2>
    <p>
        And not a drop that from our Cups we throw<br/>
        On the parcht herbage, but may steal below<br/>
        To quench the fire of Anguish in some Eye<br/>
        There hidden—far beneath, and long ago.
    </p>
    <h2>XLIII</h2>
    <p>
        As then the Tulip for her wonted sup<br/>
        Of Heavenly Vintage lifts her chalice up,<br/>
        Do you, twin offspring of the soil, till Heav’n<br/>
        To Earth invert you like an empty Cup.
    </p>
    <h2>XLIV</h2>
    <p>
        Do you, within your little hour of Grace,<br/>
        The waving Cypress in your Arms enlace,<br/>
        Before the Mother back into her arms<br/>
        Fold, and dissolve you in a last embrace.
    </p>
    <h2>XLV</h2>
    <p>
        And if the Cup you drink, the Lip you press,<br/>
        End in what All begins and ends in—Yes;<br/>
        Imagine then you are what heretofore<br/>
        You were—hereafter you shall not be less.
    </p>
    <h2>XLVI</h2>
    <p>
        So when at last the Angel of the Drink<br/>
        Of Darkness finds you by the river-brink,<br/>
        And, proffering his Cup, invites your Soul<br/>
        Forth to your Lips to quaff it—do not shrink.
    </p>
    <h2>XLVII</h2>
    <p>
        And fear not lest Existence closing your<br/>
        Account, should lose, or know the type no more;<br/>
        The Eternal Sa´kì from that Bowl has pour’d<br/>
        Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.
    </p>
    <h2>XLVIII</h2>
    <p>
        When You and I behind the Veil are past,<br/>
        Oh, but the long long while the World shall last,<br/>
        Which of our Coming and Departure heeds<br/>
        As much as Ocean of a pebble-cast.
    </p>
    <h2>XLIX</h2>
    <p>
        One Moment in Annihilation’s Waste,<br/>
        One Moment, of the Well of Life to taste—<br/>
        The Stars are setting, and the Caravan<br/>
        Draws to the Dawn of Nothing—Oh make haste.
    </p>
    <h2>L</h2>
    <p>
        Would you that spangle of Existence spend<br/>
        About THE SECRET—quick about it, Friend!<br/>
        A Hair, they say, divides the False and True—<br/>
        And upon what, prithee, does Life depend?
    </p>
    <h2>LI</h2>
    <p>
        A Hair, they say, divides the False and True;<br/>
        Yes; and a single Alif were the clue—<br/>
        Could you but find it—to the Treasure-house,<br/>
        And peradventure to THE MASTER too;
    </p>
    <h2>LII</h2>
    <p>
        Whose secret Presence, through Creation’s veins<br/>
        Running, Quicksilver-like eludes your pains;<br/>
        Taking all shapes from Ma´h to Ma´hi; and<br/>
        They change and perish all-but He remains;
    </p>
    <h2>LIII</h2>
    <p>
        A moment guess’d—then back behind the Fold<br/>
        Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll’d<br/>
        Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,<br/>
        He does Himself contrive, enact, behold.
    </p>
    <h2>LIV</h2>
    <p>
        But it in vain, down on the stubborn floor<br/>
        Of Earth, and up to Heav’n’s unopening Door,<br/>
        You gaze TO-DAY, while You are YOU—how then<br/>
        TO-MORROW, You when shall be You no more?
    </p>
    <h2>LV</h2>
    <p>
        Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,<br/>
        To-morrow’s tangle to itself resign,<br/>
        And lose your fingers in the tresses of<br/>
        The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.
    </p>
    <h2>LVI</h2>
    <p>
        Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit<br/>
        Of This and That endeavour and dispute;<br/>
        Better be merry with the fruitful Grape<br/>
        Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.
    </p>
    <h2>LVII</h2>
    <p>
        You know, my Friends, how bravely in my House<br/>
        For a new Marriage I did make Carouse;<br/>
        Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br/>
        And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.
    </p>
    <h2>LVIII</h2>
    <p>
        For “IS” and “IS-NOT” though with Rule and Line<br/>
        And “UP-AND-DOWN” by Logic I define,<br/>
        Of all that one should care to fathom, I<br/>
        Was never deep in anything but—Wine.
    </p>
    <h2>LIX</h2>
    <p>
        Ah, but my Computations, People say,<br/>
        Have squared the Year to human compass, eh?<br/>
        If so, by striking from the Calendar<br/>
        Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday.
    </p>
    <h2>LX</h2>
    <p>
        And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,<br/>
        Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape<br/>
        Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and<br/>
        He bid me taste of it; and ’twas—the Grape!
    </p>
    <h2>LXI</h2>
    <p>
        The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br/>
        The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:<br/>
        The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice<br/>
        Life’s leaden metal into Gold transmute:
    </p>
    <h2>LXII</h2>
    <p>
        The mighty Mahmu´d, Allah-breathing Lord,<br/>
        That all the misbelieving and black Horde<br/>
        Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul<br/>
        Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.
    </p>
    <h2>LXIII</h2>
    <p>
        Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare<br/>
        Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?<br/>
        A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?<br/>
        And if a Curse—why, then, Who set it there?
    </p>
    <h2>LXIV</h2>
    <p>
        I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,<br/>
        Scared by some After-reckoning ta’en on trust,<br/>
        Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink,<br/>
        When the frail Cup is crumbled into Dust!
    </p>
    <h2>LXV</h2>
    <p>
        If but the Vine and Love-abjuring Band<br/>
        Are in the Prophet’s Paradise to stand,<br/>
        Alack, I doubt the Prophet’s Paradise<br/>
        Were empty as the hollow of one’s Hand.
    </p>
    <h2>LXVI</h2>
    <p>
        Oh threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<br/>
        One thing at least is certain—This Life flies;<br/>
        One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;<br/>
        The Flower that once is blown for ever dies.
    </p>
    <h2>LXVII</h2>
    <p>
        Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who<br/>
        Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through,<br/>
        Not one returns to tell us of the Road,<br/>
        Which to discover we must travel too.
    </p>
    <h2>LXVIII</h2>
    <p>
        The Revelations of Devout and Learn’d<br/>
        Who rose before us, and as Prophets burn’d,<br/>
        Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep<br/>
        They told their fellows, and to Sleep return’d.
    </p>
    <h2>LXIX</h2>
    <p>
        Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,<br/>
        And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,<br/>
        Is’t not a Shame—is’t not a Shame for him<br/>
        So long in this Clay Suburb to abide?
    </p>
    <h2>LXX</h2>
    <p>
        But that is but a Tent wherein may rest<br/>
        A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;<br/>
        The Sulta´n rises, and the dark Ferra´sh<br/>
        Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXI</h2>
    <p>
        I sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br/>
        Some letter of that After-life to spell:<br/>
        And after many days my Soul return’d,<br/>
        And said, “Behold, Myself am Heav’n and Hell:”
    </p>
    <h2>LXXII</h2>
    <p>
        Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,<br/>
        And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,<br/>
        Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,<br/>
        So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXIII</h2>
    <p>
        We are no other than a moving row<br/>
        Of visionary Shapes that come and go<br/>
        Round with this Sun-illumin’d Lantern held<br/>
        In Midnight by the Master of the Show;
    </p>
    <h2>LXXIV</h2>
    <p>
        Impotent Pieces of the Game He plays<br/>
        Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;<br/>
        Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,<br/>

        The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes,<br/>
        But Right or Left as strikes the Player goes;<br/>
        And He that toss’d you down into the Field,<br/>
        He knows about it all—HE knows—HE knows!
    </p>
    <h2>LXXVI</h2>
    <p>
        The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br/>
        Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br/>
        Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br/>
        Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXVII</h2>
    <p>
        For let Philosopher and Doctor preach<br/>
        Of what they will, and what they will not—each<br/>
        Is but one Link in an eternal Chain<br/>
        That none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach.

    <p>
        And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,<br/>
        Whereunder crawling coop’d we live and die,<br/>
        Lift not your hands to It for help—for It<br/>
        As impotently rolls as you or I.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXIX</h2>
    <p>
        With Earth’s first Clay They did the Last Man knead,<br/>
        And there of the Last Harvest sow’d the Seed:<br/>
        And the first Morning of Creation wrote<br/>
        What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.

    <p>
        YESTERDAY This Day’s Madness did prepare;<br/>
        TO-MORROW’S Silence, Triumph, or Despair:<br/>
        Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:<br/>
        Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXI</h2>
    <p>
        I tell you this—When, started from the Goal,<br/>
        Over the flaming shoulders of the Foal<br/>
        Of Heav’n Parwi´n and Mushtari they flung,<br/>
        In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXII</h2>
    <p>
        The Vine had struck a fibre: which about<br/>
        If clings my being—let the Dervish flout;<br/>
        Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,<br/>
        That shall unlock the Door he howls without.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXIII</h2>
    <p>
        And this I know: whether the one True Light<br/>
        Kindle to Love, or Wrath-consume me quite,<br/>
        One Flash of It within the Tavern caught<br/>
        Better than in the Temple lost outright.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXIV</h2>
    <p>
        What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke<br/>
        A conscious Something to resent the yoke<br/>
        Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain<br/>
        Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke!
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXV</h2>
    <p>
        What! from his helpless Creature be repaid<br/>
        Pure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay’d<br/>
        Sue for a Debt we never did contract,<br/>
        And cannot answer—Oh the sorry trade!
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXVI</h2>
    <p>
        Nay, but, for terror of his wrathful Face,<br/>
        I swear I will not call Injustice Grace;<br/>
        Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern but<br/>
        Would kick so poor a Coward from the place.
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXVII</h2>
    <p>
        Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin<br/>
        Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br/>
        Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round<br/>
        Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br/>
        And ev’n with Paradise devise the Snake:<br/>
        For all the Sin the Face of wretched Man<br/>
        Is black with—Man’s Forgiveness give—and take!
    </p>
    <h2>LXXXIX</h2>
    <p>
        As under cover of departing Day<br/>
        Slunk hunger-stricken Ramaza´n away,<br/>
        Once more within the Potter’s house alone<br/>
        I stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay.
    </p>
    <h2>XC</h2>
    <p>
        And once again there gather’d a scarce heard<br/>
        Whisper among them; as it were, the stirr’d<br/>
        Ashes of some all but extinguisht Tongue,<br/>
        Which mine ear kindled into living Word.
    </p>
    <h2>XCI</h2>
    <p>
        Said one among them—“Surely not in vain<br/>
        My substance from the common Earth was ta’en<br/>
        That he who subtly wrought me into Shape<br/>
        Should stamp me back to shapeless Earth again?”
    </p>
    <h2>XCII</h2>
    <p>
        Another said—“Why, ne’er a peevish Boy<br/>
        Would break the Cup from which he drank in Joy;<br/>
        Shall He that of His own free Fancy made<br/>
        The Vessel, in an after-rage destroy!”
    </p>
    <h2>XCIII</h2>
    <p>
        None answer’d this; but after silence spake<br/>
        Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make;<br/>
        “They sneer at me for leaning all awry:<br/>
        What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?”
    </p>
    <h2>XCIV</h2>
    <p>
        Thus with the Dead as with the Living, What?<br/>
        And Why? so ready, but the Wherefor not,<br/>
        One on a sudden peevishly exclaim’d,<br/>
        “Which is the Potter, pray, and which the Pot?”
    </p>
    <h2>XCV</h2>
    <p>
        Said one—“Folks of a surly Master tell,<br/>
        And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;<br/>
        They talk of some sharp Trial of us—Pish!<br/>
        He’s a Good Fellow, and ’twill all be well.”
    </p>
    <h2>XCVI</h2>
    <p>
        “Well,” said another, “Whoso will, let try,<br/>
        My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:<br/>
        But fill me with the old familiar Juice,<br/>
        Methinks I might recover by and by.”
    </p>
    <h2>XCVII</h2>
    <p>
        So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,<br/>
        One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:<br/>
        And then they jogg’d each other, “Brother! Brother!<br/>
        Now for the Porter’s shoulder-knot a-creaking!”
    </p>
    <h2>XCVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,<br/>
        And wash my Body whence the Life has died,<br/>
        And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf,<br/>
        By some not unfrequented Garden-side.
    </p>
    <h2>XCIX</h2>
    <p>
        Whither resorting from the vernal Heat<br/>
        Shall Old Acquaintance Old Acquaintance greet,<br/>
        Under the Branch that leans above the Wall<br/>
        To shed his Blossom over head and feet.
    </p>
    <h2>C</h2>
    <p>
        Then ev’n my buried Ashes such a snare<br/>
        Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air<br/>
        As not a True-believer passing by<br/>
        But shall be overtaken unaware.
    </p>
    <h2>CI</h2>
    <p>
        Indeed the Idols I have loved so long<br/>
        Have done my credit in Men’s eyes much wrong:<br/>
        Have drown’d my Glory in a shallow Cup<br/>
        And sold my Reputation for a Song.
    </p>
    <h2>CII</h2>
    <p>
        Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before<br/>
        I swore—but was I sober when I swore?<br/>
        And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand<br/>
        My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.
    </p>
    <h2>CIII</h2>
    <p>
        And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,<br/>
        And robb’d me of my Robe of Honour—Well,<br/>
        I often wonder what the Vintners buy<br/>
        One half so precious as the ware they sell.
    </p>
    <h2>CIV</h2>
    <p>
        Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!<br/>
        That Youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!<br/>
        The Nightingale that in the branches sang,<br/>
        Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!
    </p>
    <h2>CV</h2>
    <p>
        Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield<br/>
        One glimpse—if dimly, yet indeed, reveal’d,<br/>
        Toward which the fainting Traveller might spring,<br/>
        As springs the trampled herbage of the field!
    </p>
    <h2>CVI</h2>
    <p>
        Oh if the World were but to re-create,<br/>
        That we might catch ere closed the Book of Fate,<br/>
        And make The Writer on a fairer leaf<br/>
        Inscribe our names, or quite obliterate!
    </p>
    <h2>CVII</h2>
    <p>
        Better, oh better, cancel from the Scroll<br/>
        Of Universe one luckless Human Soul,<br/>
        Than drop by drop enlarge the Flood that rolls<br/>
        Hoarser with Anguish as the Ages roll.
    </p>
    <h2>CVIII</h2>
    <p>
        Ah Love! could you and I with Fate conspire<br/>
        To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br/>
        Would not we shatter it to bits—and then<br/>
        Re-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!
    </p>
    <h2>CIX</h2>
    <p>
        But see! The rising Moon of Heav’n again<br/>
        Looks for us, Sweet-heart, through the quivering Plane:<br/>
        How oft hereafter rising will she look<br/>
        Among those leaves—for one of us in vain!
    </p>
    <h2>CX</h2>
    <p>
        And when Yourself with silver Foot shall pass<br/>
        Among the Guests Star-scatter’d on the Grass,<br/>
        And in your joyous errand reach the spot<br/>
        Where I made One—turn down an empty Glass!
