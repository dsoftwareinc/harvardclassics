        [These “Orders” were adopted by a popular convention of the three towns of Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield,
        on January 14, 1639. They form, according to historians, “the first written constitution, in the modern sense of
        the term, as a permanent limitation on governmental power, known in history, and certainly the first American
        constitution of government to embody the democratic idea.”]
