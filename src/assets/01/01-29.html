        DECEMBER 17th, 1832.—Having now finished with Patagonia and the Falkland Islands, I will describe our first
        arrival in Tierra del Fuego. A little after noon we doubled Cape St. Diego, and entered the famous strait of Le
        Maire. We kept close to the Fuegian shore, but the outline of the rugged, inhospitable Statenland was visible
        amidst the clouds. In the afternoon we anchored in the Bay of Good Success. While entering we were saluted in a
        manner becoming the inhabitants of this savage land. A group of Fuegians partly concealed by the entangled
        forest, were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea; and as we passed by, they sprang up and waving their
        tattered cloaks sent forth a loud and sonorous shout. The savages followed the ship, and just before dark we saw
        their fire, and again heard their wild cry. The harbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low
        rounded mountains of clay-slate, which are covered to the water’s edge by one dense gloomy forest. A single
        glance at the landscape was sufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything I had ever beheld.
        At night it blew a gale of wind, and heavy squalls from the mountains swept past us. It would have been a bad
        time out at sea, and we, as well as others, may call this Good Success Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the morning the Captain sent a party to communicate with the Fuegians. When we came within hail, one of the
        four natives who were present advanced to receive us, and began to shout most vehemently, wishing to direct us
        where to land. When we were on shore the party looked rather alarmed, but continued talking and making gestures
        with great rapidity. It was without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could
        not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a
        wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement. The chief spokesman
        was old, and appeared to be the head of the family; the three others were powerful young men, about six feet
        high. The women and children had been sent away. These Fuegians are a very different race from the stunted,
        miserable wretches farther westward; and they seem closely allied to the famous Patagonians of the Strait of
        Magellan. Their only garment consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin, with the wool outside: this they wear
        just thrown over their shoulders, leaving their persons as often exposed as covered. Their skin is of a dirty
        coppery-red colour.
    </p>
    <p>
        The old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head, which partly confined his black, coarse, and
        entangled hair. His face was crossed by two broad transverse bars; one, painted bright red, reached from ear to
        ear and included the upper lip; the other, white like chalk, extended above and parallel to the first, so that
        even his eyelids were thus coloured. The other two men were ornamented by streaks of black powder, made of
        charcoal. The party altogether closely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like Der
        Freischutz.
    </p>
    <p>
        Their very attitudes were abject, and the expression of their countenances distrustful, surprised, and startled.
        After we had presented them with some scarlet cloth, which they immediately tied round their necks, they became
        good friends. This was shown by the old man patting our breasts, and making a chuckling kind of noise, as people
        do when feeding chickens. I walked with the old man, and this demonstration of friendship was repeated several
        times; it was concluded by three hard slaps, which were given me on the breast and back at the same time. He
        then bared his bosom for me to return the compliment, which being done, he seemed highly pleased. The language
        of these people, according to our notions, scarcely deserves to be called articulate. Captain Cook has compared
        it to a man clearing his throat, but certainly no European ever cleared his throat with so many hoarse,
        guttural, and clicking sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are excellent mimics: as often as we coughed or yawned, or made any odd motion, they immediately imitated
        us. Some of our party began to squint and look awry; but one of the young Fuegians (whose whole face was painted
        black, excepting a white band across his eyes) succeeded in making far more hideous grimaces. They could repeat
        with perfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them, and they remembered such words for some
        time. Yet we Europeans all know how difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign language. Which
        of us, for instance, could follow an American Indian through a sentence of more than three words? All savages
        appear to possess, to an uncommon degree, this power of mimicry. I was told, almost in the same words, of the
        same ludicrous habit among the Caffres; the Australians, likewise, have long been notorious for being able to
        imitate and describe the gait of any man, so that he may be recognized. How can this faculty be explained? is it
        a consequence of the more practised habits of perception and keener senses, common to all men in a savage state,
        as compared with those long civilized?
    </p>
    <p>
        When a song was struck up by our party, I thought the Fuegians would have fallen down with astonishment. With
        equal surprise they viewed our dancing; but one of the young men, when asked, had no objection to a little
        waltzing. Little accustomed to Europeans as they appeared to be, yet they knew and dreaded our fire-arms;
        nothing would tempt them to take a gun in their hands. They begged for knives, calling them by the Spanish word
        “cuchilla.” They explained also what they wanted, by acting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth,
        and then pretending to cut instead of tear it.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have not as yet noticed the Fuegians whom we had on board. During the former voyage of the Adventure and
        Beagle in 1826 to 1830, Captain Fitz Roy seized on a party of natives, as hostages for the loss of a boat, which
        had been stolen, to the great jeopardy of a party employed on the survey; and some of these natives, as well as
        a child whom he bought for a pearl-button, he took with him to England, determining to educate them and instruct
        them in religion at his own expense. To settle these natives in their own country, was one chief inducement to
        Captain Fitz Roy to undertake our present voyage; and before the Admiralty had resolved to send out this
        expedition, Captain Fitz Roy had generously chartered a vessel, and would himself have taken them back. The
        natives were accompanied by a missionary, R. Matthews; of whom and of the natives, Captain Fitz Roy had
        published a full and excellent account. Two men, one of whom died in England of the small-pox, a boy and a
        little girl, were originally taken; and we had now on board, York Minster, Jemmy Button (whose name expresses
        his purchase-money), and Fuegia Basket. York Minster was a full-grown, short, thick, powerful man: his
        disposition was reserved, taciturn, morose, and when excited violently passionate; his affections were very
        strong towards a few friends on board; his intellect good. Jemmy Button was a universal favourite, but likewise
        passionate; the expression of his face at once showed his nice disposition. He was merry and often laughed, and
        was remarkably sympathetic with any one in pain: when the water was rough, I was often a little sea-sick, and he
        used to come to me and say in a plaintive voice, “Poor, poor fellow!” but the notion, after his aquatic life, of
        a man being sea-sick, was too ludicrous, and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide a smile or
        laugh, and then he would repeat his “Poor, poor fellow!” He was of a patriotic disposition; and he liked to
        praise his own tribe and country, in which he truly said there were “plenty of trees,” and he abused all the
        other tribes: he stoutly declared that there was no Devil in his land. Jemmy was short, thick, and fat, but vain
        of his personal appearance; he used always to wear gloves, his hair was neatly cut, and he was distressed if his
        well-polished shoes were dirtied. He was fond of admiring himself in a looking glass; and a merry-faced little
        Indian boy from the Rio Negro, whom we had for some months on board, soon perceived this, and used to mock him:
        Jemmy, who was always rather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy, did not at all like this, and
        used to say, with rather a contemptuous twist of his head, “Too much skylark.” It seems yet wonderful to me,
        when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken
        of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here. Lastly, Fuegia Basket was a
        nice, modest, reserved young girl, with a rather pleasing but sometimes sullen expression, and very quick in
        learning anything, especially languages. This she showed in picking up some Portuguese and Spanish, when left on
        shore for only a short time at Rio de Janeiro and Monte Video, and in her knowledge of English. York Minster was
        very jealous of any attention paid to her; for it was clear he determined to marry her as soon as they were
        settled on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although all three could both speak and understand a good deal of English, it was singularly difficult to obtain
        much information from them, concerning the habits of their countrymen; this was partly owing to their apparent
        difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative. Every one accustomed to very young children, knows how
        seldom one can get an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black or white; the idea of
        black or white seems alternately to fill their minds. So it was with these Fuegians, and hence it was generally
        impossible to find out, by cross-questioning, whether one had rightly understood anything which they had
        asserted. Their sight was remarkably acute; it is well known that sailors, from long practice, can make out a
        distant object much better than a landsman; but both York and Jemmy were much superior to any sailor on board:
        several times they have declared what some distant object has been, and though doubted by every one, they have
        proved right, when it has been examined through a telescope. They were quite conscious of this power; and Jemmy,
        when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch, would say, “Me see ship, me no tell.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages, when we landed, towards Jemmy Button: they immediately
        perceived the difference between him and ourselves, and held much conversation one with another on the subject.
        The old man addressed a long harangue to Jemmy, which it seems was to invite him to stay with them. But Jemmy
        understood very little of their language, and was, moreover, thoroughly ashamed of his countrymen. When York
        Minster afterwards came on shore, they noticed him in the same way, and told him he ought to shave; yet he had
        not twenty dwarf hairs on his face, whilst we all wore our untrimmed beards. They examined the colour of his
        skin, and compared it with ours. One of our arms being bared, they expressed the liveliest surprise and
        admiration at its whiteness, just in the same way in which I have seen the ourang-outang do at the Zoological
        Gardens. We thought that they mistook two or three of the officers, who were rather shorter and fairer, though
        adorned with large beards, for the ladies of our party. The tallest amongst the Fuegians was evidently much
        pleased at his height being noticed. When placed back to back with the tallest of the boat’s crew, he tried his
        best to edge on higher ground, and to stand on tiptoe. He opened his mouth to show his teeth, and turned his
        face for a side view; and all this was done with such alacrity, that I dare say he thought himself the
        handsomest man in Tierra del Fuego. After our first feeling of grave astonishment was over, nothing could be
        more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which these savages every moment exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day I attempted to penetrate some way into the country. Tierra del Fuego may be described as a
        mountainous land, partly submerged in the sea, so that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys
        should exist. The mountain sides, except on the exposed western coast, are covered from the water’s edge upwards
        by one great forest. The trees reach to an elevation of between 1000 and 1500 feet, and are succeeded by a band
        of peat, with minute alpine plants; and this again is succeeded by the line of perpetual snow, which, according
        to Captain King, in the Strait of Magellan descends to between 3000 and 4000 feet. To find an acre of level land
        in any part of the country is most rare. I recollect only one little flat piece near Port Famine, and another of
        rather larger extent near Goeree Road. In both places, and everywhere else, the surface is covered by a thick
        bed of swampy peat. Even within the forest, the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying vegetable
        matter, which, from being soaked with water, yields to the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood, I followed the course of a mountain torrent. At
        first, from the waterfalls and number of dead trees, I could hardly crawl along; but the bed of the stream soon
        became a little more open, from the floods having swept the sides. I continued slowly to advance for an hour
        along the broken and rocky banks, and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene. The gloomy depth of the
        ravine well accorded with the universal signs of violence. On every side were lying irregular masses of rock and
        torn-up trees; other trees, though still erect, were decayed to the heart and ready to fall. The entangled mass
        of the thriving and the fallen reminded me of the forests within the tropics—yet there was a difference: for in
        these still solitudes, Death, instead of Life, seemed the predominant spirit. I followed the watercourse till I
        came to a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the mountain side. By this road I ascended
        to a considerable elevation, and obtained a good view of the surrounding woods. The trees all belong to one
        kind, the Fagus betuloides; for the number of the other species of Fagus and of the Winter’s Bark, is quite
        inconsiderable. This beech keeps its leaves throughout the year; but its foliage is of a peculiar brownish-green
        colour, with a tinge of yellow. As the whole landscape is thus coloured, it has a sombre, dull appearance; nor
        is it often enlivened by the rays of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
        December 20th.—One side of the harbour is formed by a hill about 1500 feet high, which Captain Fitz Roy has
        called after Sir J. Banks, in commemoration of his disastrous excursion, which proved fatal to two men of his
        party, and nearly so to Dr. Solander. The snowstorm, which was the cause of their misfortune, happened in the
        middle of January, corresponding to our July, and in the latitude of Durham! I was anxious to reach the summit
        of this mountain to collect alpine plants; for flowers of any kind in the lower parts are few in number. We
        followed the same watercourse as on the previous day, till it dwindled away, and we were then compelled to crawl
        blindly among the trees. These, from the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds, were low, thick
        and crooked. At length we reached that which from a distance appeared like a carpet of fine green turf, but
        which, to our vexation, turned out to be a compact mass of little beech-trees about four or five feet high. They
        were as thick together as box in the border of a garden, and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but
        treacherous surface. After a little more trouble we gained the peat, and then the bare slate rock.
    </p>
    <p>
        A ridge connected this hill with another, distant some miles, and more lofty, so that patches of snow were lying
        on it. As the day was not far advanced, I determined to walk there and collect plants along the road. It would
        have been very hard work, had it not been for a well-beaten and straight path made by the guanacos; for these
        animals, like sheep, always follow the same line. When we reached the hill we found it the highest in the
        immediate neighbourhood, and the waters flowed to the sea in opposite directions. We obtained a wide view over
        the surrounding country: to the north a swampy moorland extended, but to the south we had a scene of savage
        magnificence, well becoming Tierra del Fuego. There was a degree of mysterious grandeur in mountain behind
        mountain, with the deep intervening valleys, all covered by one thick, dusky mass of forest. The atmosphere,
        likewise, in this climate, where gale succeeds gale, with rain, hail, and sleet, seems blacker than anywhere
        else. In the Strait of Magellan looking due southward from Port Famine, the distant channels between the
        mountains appeared from their gloominess to lead beyond the confines of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
        December 21st.—The Beagle got under way: and on the succeeding day, favoured to an uncommon degree by a fine
        easterly breeze, we closed in with the Barnevelts, and running past Cape Deceit with its stony peaks, about
        three o’clock doubled the weather-beaten Cape Horn. The evening was calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view
        of the surrounding isles. Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before night sent us a gale of wind
        directly in our teeth. We stood out to sea, and on the second day again made the land, when we saw on our
        weather-bow this notorious promontory in its proper form—veiled in a mist, and its dim outline surrounded by a
        storm of wind and water. Great black clouds were rolling across the heavens, and squalls of rain, with hail,
        swept by us with such extreme violence, that the Captain determined to run into Wigwam Cove. This is a snug
        little harbour, not far from Cape Horn; and here, at Christmas-eve, we anchored in smooth water. The only thing
        which reminded us of the gale outside, was every now and then a puff from the mountains, which made the ship
        surge at her anchors.
    </p>
    <p>
        December 25th.—Close by the Cove, a pointed hill, called Kater’s Peak, rises to the height of 1700 feet. The
        surrounding islands all consist of conical masses of greenstone, associated sometimes with less regular hills of
        baked and altered clay-slate. This part of Tierra del Fuego may be considered as the extremity of the submerged
        chain of mountains already alluded to. The cove takes its name of “Wigwam” from some of the Fuegian habitations;
        but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so called with equal propriety. The inhabitants, living chiefly upon
        shell-fish, are obliged constantly to change their place of residence; but they return at intervals to the same
        spots, as is evident from the piles of old shells, which must often amount to many tons in weight. These heaps
        can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green colour of certain plants, which invariably grow on
        them. Among these may be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass, two very serviceable plants, the use of
        which has not been discovered by the natives.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Fuegian wigwam resembles, in size and dimensions, a haycock. It merely consists of a few broken branches
        stuck in the ground, and very imperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes. The whole
        cannot be the work of an hour, and it is only used for a few days. At Goeree Roads I saw a place where one of
        these naked men had slept, which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare. The man was evidently
        living by himself, and York Minster said he was “very bad man,” and that probably he had stolen something. On
        the west coast, however, the wigwams are rather better, for they are covered with seal-skins. We were detained
        here several days by the bad weather. The climate is certainly wretched: the summer solstice was now passed, yet
        every day snow fell on the hills, and in the valleys there was rain, accompanied by sleet. The thermometer
        generally stood about 45°, but in the night fell to 38° or 40°. From the damp and boisterous state of the
        atmosphere, not cheered by a gleam of sunshine, one fancied the climate even worse than it really was.
    </p>
    <p>
        While going one day on shore near Wollaston Island, we pulled alongside a canoe with six Fuegians. These were
        the most abject and miserable creatures I anywhere beheld. On the east coast the natives, as we have seen, have
        guanaco cloaks, and on the west they possess seal-skins. Amongst these central tribes the men generally have an
        otter-skin, or some small scrap about as large as a pocket-handkerchief, which is barely sufficient to cover
        their backs as low down as their loins. It is laced across the breast by strings, aid according as the wind
        blows, it is shifted from side to side. But these Fuegians in the canoe were quite naked, and even one
        full-grown woman was absolutely so. It was raining heavily, and the fresh water, together with the spray,
        trickled down her body. In another harbour not far distant, a woman, who was suckling a recently-born child,
        came one day alongside the vessel, and remained there out of mere curiosity, whilst the sleet fell and thawed on
        her naked bosom, and on the skin of her naked baby! These poor wretches were stunted in their growth, their
        hideous faces bedaubed with white paint, their skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled, their voices
        discordant, and their gestures violent. Viewing such men, one can hardly make one’s self believe that they are
        fellow-creatures, and inhabitants of the same world. It is a common subject of conjecture what pleasure in life
        some of the lower animals can enjoy: how much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to
        these barbarians! At night, five or six human beings, naked and scarcely protected from the wind and rain of
        this tempestuous climate, sleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals. Whenever it is low water, winter or
        summer, night or day they must rise to pick shell-fish from the rocks; and the women either dive to collect
        sea-eggs, or sit patiently in their canoes, and with a baited hair-line without any hook, jerk out little fish.
        If a seal is killed, or the floating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered, it is a feast; and such miserable
        food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi.
    </p>
    <p>
        They often suffer from famine: I heard Mr. Low, a sealing-master intimately acquainted with the natives of this
        country, give a curious account of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the west coast, who
        were very thin and in great distress. A succession of gales prevented the women from getting shell-fish on the
        rocks, and they could not go out in their canoes to catch seal. A small party of these men one morning set out,
        and the other Indians explained to him, that they were going a four days’ journey for food: on their return, Low
        went to meet them, and he found them excessively tired, each man carrying a great square piece of putrid
        whale’s-blubber with a hole in the middle, through which they put their heads, like the Gauchos do through their
        ponchos or cloaks. As soon as the blubber was brought into a wigwam, an old man cut off thin slices, and
        muttering over them, broiled them for a minute, and distributed them to the famished party, who during this time
        preserved a profound silence. Mr. Low believes that whenever a whale is cast on shore, the natives bury large
        pieces of it in the sand, as a resource in time of famine; and a native boy, whom he had on board, once found a
        stock thus buried. The different tribes when at war are cannibals. From the concurrent, but quite independent
        evidence of the boy taken by Mr. Low, and of Jemmy Button, it is certainly true, that when pressed in winter by
        hunger, they kill and devour their old women before they kill their dogs: the boy, being asked by Mr. Low why
        they did this, answered, “Doggies catch otters, old women no.” This boy described the manner in which they are
        killed by being held over smoke and thus choked; he imitated their screams as a joke, and described the parts of
        their bodies which are considered best to eat. Horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and
        relatives must be, the fears of the old women, when hunger begins to press, are more painful to think of; we are
        told that they then often run away into the mountains, but that they are pursued by the men and brought back to
        the slaughter-house at their own firesides!
    </p>
    <p>
        Captain Fitz Roy could never ascertain that the Fuegians have any distinct belief in a future life. They
        sometimes bury their dead in caves, and sometimes in the mountain forests; we do not know what ceremonies they
        perform. Jemmy Button would not eat land-birds, because “eat dead men”: they are unwilling even to mention their
        dead friends. We have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious worship; though perhaps the
        muttering of the old man before he distributed the putrid blubber to his famished party, may be of this nature.
        Each family or tribe has a wizard or conjuring doctor, whose office we could never clearly ascertain. Jemmy
        believed in dreams, though not, as I have said, in the devil: I do not think that our Fuegians were much more
        superstitious than some of the sailors; for an old quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy
        gales, which we encountered off Cape Horn, were caused by our having the Fuegians on board. The nearest approach
        to a religious feeling which I heard of, was shown by York Minster, who, when Mr. Bynoe shot some very young
        ducklings as specimens, declared in the most solemn manner, “Oh, Mr. Bynoe, much rain, snow, blow much.” This
        was evidently a retributive punishment for wasting human food. In a wild and excited manner he also related,
        that his brother, one day whilst returning to pick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast, observed
        some feathers blown by the wind. His brother said (York imitating his manner), “What that?” and crawling
        onwards, he peeped over the cliff, and saw “wild man” picking his birds; he crawled a little nearer, and then
        hurled down a great stone and killed him. York declared for a long time afterwards storms raged, and much rain
        and snow fell. As far as we could make out, he seemed to consider the elements themselves as the avenging
        agents: it is evident in this case, how naturally, in a race a little more advanced in culture, the elements
        would become personified. What the “bad wild men” were, has always appeared to me most mysterious: from what
        York said, when we found the place like the form of a hare, where a single man had slept the night before, I
        should have thought that they were thieves who had been driven from their tribes; but other obscure speeches
        made me doubt this; I have sometimes imagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane.

        The different tribes have no government or chief; yet each is surrounded by other hostile tribes, speaking
        different dialects, and separated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral; territory: the cause of
        their warfare appears to be the means of subsistence. Their country is a broken mass of wild rocks, lofty hills,
        and useless forests: and these are viewed through mists and endless storms. The habitable land is reduced to the
        stones on the beach; in search of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from spot to spot, and so steep
        is the coast, that they can only move about in their wretched canoes. They cannot know the feeling of having a
        home, and still less that of domestic affection; for the husband is to the wife a brutal master to a laborious
        slave. Was a more horrid deed ever perpetrated, than that witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who saw a
        wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant-boy, whom her husband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for
        dropping a basket of sea-eggs. How little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into play: what is there
        for imagination to picture, for reason to compare, for judgment to decide upon? to knock a limpet from the rock
        does not require even cunning, that lowest power of the mind. Their skill in some respects may be compared to
        the instinct of animals; for it is not improved by experience: the canoe, their most ingenious work, poor as it
        is, has remained the same, as we know from Drake, for the last two hundred and fifty years.

        Whilst beholding these savages, one asks, whence have they come? What could have tempted, or what change
        compelled a tribe of men, to leave the fine regions of the north, to travel down the Cordillera or backbone of
        America, to invent and build canoes, which are not used by the tribes of Chile, Peru, and Brazil, and then to
        enter on one of the most inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe? Although such reflections must
        at first seize on the mind, yet we may feel sure that they are partly erroneous. There is no reason to believe
        that the Fuegians decrease in number; therefore we must suppose that they enjoy a sufficient share of happiness,
        of whatever kind it may be, to render life worth having. Nature by making habit omnipotent, and its effects
        hereditary, has fitted the Fuegian to the climate and the productions of his miserable country.
