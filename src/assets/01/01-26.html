        Down to the time when Rhampsinitos was king, they told me there was in Egypt nothing but orderly rule, and Egypt
        prospered greatly; but after him Cheops became king over them and brought them to every kind of evil: for he
        shut up all the temples, and having first kept them from sacrifices there, he then bade all the Egyptians work
        for him. So some were appointed to draw stones from the stone-quarries in the Arabian mountains to the Nile, and
        others he ordered to receive the stones after they had been carried over the river in boats, and to draw them to
        those which are called the Libyan mountains; and they worked by a hundred thousand men at a time, for each three
        months continually. Of this oppression there passed ten years while the causeway was made by which they drew the
        stones, which causeway they built, and it is a work not much less, as it appears to me, than the pyramid; for
        the length of it is five furlongs and the breadth ten fathoms and the height, where it is highest, eight
        fathoms, and it is made of stone smoothed and with figures carved upon it. For this they said, the ten years
        were spent, and for the underground chambers on the hill upon which the pyramids stand, which he caused to be
        made as sepulchral chambers for himself in an island, having conducted thither a channel from the Nile. For the
        making of the pyramid itself there passed a period of twenty years; and the pyramid is square, each side
        measuring eight hundred feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted
        together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than thirty feet in length. This pyramid
        was made after the manner of steps, which some called “rows” and others “bases”: and when they had first made it
        thus, they raised the remaining stones with machines made of short pieces of timber, raising them first from the
        ground to the first stage of the steps, and when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine
        standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as
        were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same
        machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the
        stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However that may be, the highest parts of
        it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they
        finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges. On the pyramid it is declared in Egyptian
        writing how much was spent on radishes and onions and leeks for the workmen, and if I rightly remember that
        which the interpreter said in reading to me this inscription, a sum of one thousand six hundred talents of
        silver was spent; and if this is so, how much besides is likely to have been expended upon the iron with which
        they worked, and upon bread and clothing for the workmen, seeing that they were building the works for the time
        which has been mentioned and were occupied for no small time besides, as I suppose, in the cutting and bringing
        of the stones and in working at the excavation under the ground? Cheops moreover came, they said, to such a
        pitch of wickedness, that being in want of money he caused his own daughter to sit in the stews, and ordered her
        to obtain from those who came a certain amount of money (how much it was they did not tell me); and she not only
        obtained the sum appointed by her father, but also she formed a design for herself privately to leave behind her
        a memorial, and she requested each man who came in to her to give her one stone upon her building: and of these
        stones, they told me, the pyramid was built which stands in front of the great pyramid in the middle of the
        three, each side being one hundred and fifty feet in length.

    <p>
        This Cheops, the Egyptians said, reigned fifty years; and after he was dead his brother Chephren succeeded to
        the kingdom. This king followed the same manner of dealing as the other, both in all the rest and also in that
        he made a pyramid, not indeed attaining to the measurements of that which was built by the former (this I know,
        having myself also measured it), and moreover there are no underground chambers beneath nor does a channel come
        from the Nile flowing to this one as to the other, in which the water coming through a conduit built for it
        flows round an island within, where they say that Cheops himself is laid: but for a basement he built the first
        course of Ethiopian stone of divers colours; and this pyramid he made forty feet lower than the other as regards
        size, building it close to the great pyramid. These stand both upon the same hill, which is about a hundred feet
        high. And Chephren, they said, reigned fifty and six years. Here then they reckon one hundred and six years,
        during which they say that there was nothing but evil for the Egyptians, and the temples were kept closed and
        not opened during all that time. These kings the Egyptians by reason of their hatred of them are not very
        willing to name; nay, they even call the pyramids after the name of Philitis the shepherd, who at that time
        pastured flocks in those regions. After him, they said, Mykerinos became king over Egypt, who was the son of
        Cheops; and to him his father’s deeds were displeasing, and he both opened the temples and gave liberty to the
        people, who were ground down to the last extremity of evil, to return to their own business and to their
        sacrifices: also he gave decisions of their causes juster than those of all the other kings besides. In regard
        to this then they commend this king more than all the other kings who had arisen in Egypt before him; for he not
        only gave good decisions, but also when a man complained of the decision, he gave him recompense from his own
        goods and thus satisfied his desire. But while Mykerinos was acting mercifully to his subjects and practising
        this conduct which has been said, calamities befell him, of which the first was this, namely that his daughter
        died, the only child whom he had in his house: and being above measure grieved by that which had befallen him,
        and desiring to bury his daughter in a manner more remarkable than others, he made a cow of wood, which he
        covered over with gold, and then within it he buried this daughter who, as I said, had died. This cow was not
        covered up in the ground, but it might be seen even down to my own time in the city of Saïs, placed within the
        royal palace in a chamber which was greatly adorned; and they offer incense of all kinds before it every day,
        and each night a lamp burns beside it all through the night. Near this cow in another chamber stand images of
        the concubines of Mykerinos, as the priests at Saïs told me; for there are in fact colossal wooden statues, in
        number about twenty, made with naked bodies; but who they are I am not able to say, except only that which is
        reported. Some however tell about this cow and the colossal statues the following tale, namely that Mykerinos
        was enamoured of his own daughter and afterwards ravished her; and upon this they say that the girl strangled
        herself for grief, and he buried her in this cow; and her mother cut off the hands of the maids who had betrayed
        the daughter to her father; wherefore now the images of them have suffered that which the maids suffered in
        their life. In thus saying they speak idly, as it seems to me, especially in what they say about the hands of
        the statues; for as to this, even we ourselves saw that their hands had dropped off from lapse of time, and they
        were to be seen still lying at their feet even down to my time. The cow is covered up with a crimson robe,
        except only the head and the neck, which are seen, overlaid with gold very thickly; and between the horns there
        is the disc of the sun figured in gold. The cow is not standing up but kneeling, and in size it is equal to a
        large living cow. Every year it is carried forth from the chamber, at those times, I say, the Egyptians beat
        themselves for that god whom I will not name upon occasion of such a matter; at these times, I say, they also
        carry forth the cow to the light of day, for they say that she asked of her father Mykerinos, when she was
        dying, that she might look upon the sun once in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the misfortune of his daughter it happened, they said, secondly to the king as follows:—An oracle came to
        him from the city of Buto, saying that he was destined to live but six years more, in the seventh year to end
        his life: and he being indignant at it sent to the Oracle a reproach against the god, making complaint in reply
        that whereas his father and uncle, who had shut up the temples, and had not only not remembered the gods, but
        also had been destroyers of men, had lived for a long time, he himself, who practised piety, was destined to end
        his life so soon: and from the Oracle there came a second message, which said that it was for this very cause
        that he was bringing his life to a swift close; for he had not done that which it was appointed for him to do,
        since it was destined that Egypt should suffer evils for a hundred and fifty years, and the two kings who had
        arisen before him had perceived this, but he had not. Mykerinos having heard this, and considering that this
        sentence had passed upon him beyond recall, procured many lamps, and whenever night came on he lighted these and
        began to drink and take his pleasure, ceasing neither by day nor by night; and he went about to the fen-country
        and to the woods and wherever he heard there were the most suitable places of enjoyment. This he devised (having
        a mind to prove that the Oracle spoke falsely) in order that he might have twelve years of life instead of six,
        the nights being turned into days.
    </p>
    <p>
        This king also left behind him a pyramid, much smaller than that of his father, of a square shape and measuring
        on each side three hundred feet lacking twenty, built moreover of Ethiopian stone up to half the height. This
        pyramid some of the Hellenes say was built by the courtesan Rhodopis, not therein speaking rightly: and besides
        this it is evident to me that they who speak thus do not even know who Rhodopis was, for otherwise they would
        not have attributed to her the building of a pyramid like this, on which have been spent (so to speak)
        innumerable thousands of talents: moreover they do not know that Rhodopis flourished in the reign of Amasis, and
        not in this king’s reign; for Rhodopis lived very many years later than the kings who left behind them these
        pyramids. By descent she was of Thrace, and she was a slave of Iadmon the son of Hephaistopolis a Samian, and a
        fellow-slave of Esop the maker of fables; for he too was once the slave of Iadmon, as was proved especially by
        this fact, namely that when the people of Delphi repeatedly made proclamation in accordance with an oracle, to
        find some one who would take up the blood-money for the death of Esop, no one else appeared, but at length the
        grandson of Iadmon, called Iadmon also, took it up; and thus it is shown that Esop too was the slave of Iadmon.
        As for Rhodopis, she came to Egypt brought by Xanthes the Samian, and having come thither to exercise her
        calling she was redeemed from slavery for a great sum by a man of Mytilene, Charaxos son of Scamandronymos and
        brother of Sappho the lyric poet. Thus was Rhodopis set free, and she remained in Egypt and by her beauty won so
        much liking that she made great gain of money for one like Rhodopis, though not enough to suffice for the cost
        of such a pyramid as this. In truth there is no need to ascribe to her very great riches, considering that the
        tithe of her wealth may still be seen even to this time by any one who desires it: for Rhodopis wished to leave
        behind her a memorial of herself in Hellas, namely to cause a thing to be made such as happens not to have been
        thought of or dedicated in a temple by any besides, and to dedicate this at Delphi as a memorial of herself.
        Accordingly with the tithe of her wealth she caused to be made spits of iron of size large enough to pierce a
        whole ox, and many in number, going as far therein as her tithe allowed her, and she sent them to Delphi: these
        are even at the present time lying there, heaped all together behind the altar which the Chians dedicated, and
        just opposite to the cell of the temple. Now at Naucratis, as it happens, the courtesans are rather apt to win
        credit; for this woman first, about whom the story to which I refer is told, became so famous that all the
        Hellenes without exception came to know the name of Rhodopis, and then after her one whose name was Archidiche
        became a subject of song all over Hellas, though she was less talked of than the other. As for Charaxos, when
        after redeeming Rhodopis he returned back to Mytilene, Sappho in an ode violently abused him. Of Rhodopis then I
        shall say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
        After Mykerinos the priests said Asychis became king of Egypt, and he made for Hephaistos the temple gateway
        which is towards the sunrising, by far the most beautiful and the largest of the gateways; for while they all
        have figures carved upon them and innumerable ornaments of building besides, this has them very much more than
        the rest. In this king’s reign they told me that, as the circulation of money was very slow, a law was made for
        the Egyptians that a man might have that money lent to him which he needed, by offering as security the dead
        body of his father; and there was added moreover to this law another, namely that he who lent the money should
        have a claim also to the whole of the sepulchral chamber belonging to him who received it, and that the man who
        offered that security should be subject to this penalty, if he refused to pay back the debt, namely that neither
        the man himself should be allowed to have burial, when he died, either in that family burial-place or in any
        other, nor should he be allowed to bury any of his kinsmen whom he lost by death. This king desiring to surpass
        the kings of Egypt who had arisen before him left as a memorial of himself a pyramid which he made of bricks,
        and on it there is an inscription carved in stone and saying thus: “Despise not me in comparison with the
        pyramids of stone, seeing that I excel them as much as Zeus excels the other gods; for with a pole they struck
        into the lake, and whatever of the mud attached itself to the pole, this they gathered up and made bricks, and
        in such manner they finished me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Such were the deeds which this king performed: and after him reigned a blind man of the city of Anysis, whose
        name was Anysis. In his reign the Ethiopians and Sabacos the king of the Ethiopians marched upon Egypt with a
        great host of men; so this blind man departed, flying to the fen-country, and the Ethiopian was king over Egypt
        for fifty years, during which he performed deeds as follows:—whenever any man of the Egyptians committed any
        transgression, he would never put him to death, but he gave sentence upon each man according to the greatness of
        the wrong-doing, appointing them to work at throwing up an embankment before that city from whence each man came
        of those who committed wrong. Thus the cities were made higher still than before; for they were embanked first
        by those who dug the channels in the reign of Sesostris, and then secondly in the reign of the Ethiopian, and
        thus they were made very high: and while other cities in Egypt also stood high, I think in the town at Bubastis
        especially the earth was piled up. In this city there is a temple very well worthy of mention, for though there
        are other temples which are larger and built with more cost, none more than this is a pleasure to the eyes. Now
        Bubastis in the Hellenic tongue is Artemis, and her temple is ordered thus:—Except the entrance it is completely
        surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not joining one another, but each extending as far as
        the entrance of the temple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other side, each a hundred
        feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the gateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with
        figures six cubits high, very note-worthy. This temple is in the middle of the city and is looked down upon from
        all sides as one goes round, for since the city has been banked up to a height, while the temple had not been
        moved from the palace where it was at the first built, it is possible to look down into it: and round it runs a
        stone wall with figures carved upon it, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round a
        large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the breadth and length of the temple is a
        furlong every way. Opposite the entrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs, which leads
        through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth of about four hundred feet; and on this side and on
        that grow trees of height reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes. This temple then is
        thus ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final deliverance from the Ethiopian came about (they said) as follows:—he fled away because he had seen in
        his sleep a vision, in which it seemed to him that a man came and stood by him and counselled him to gather
        together all the priests in Egypt and cut them asunder in the midst. Having seen this dream, he said that it
        seemed to him that the gods were foreshowing him this to furnish an occasion against him, in order that he might
        do an impious deed with respect to religion, and so receive some evil either from the gods or from men: he would
        not however do so, but in truth (he said) the time had expired, during which it had been prophesied to him that
        he should rule Egypt before he departed thence. For when he was in Ethiopia the Oracles which the Ethiopians
        consult had told him that it was fated for him to rule Egypt fifty years: since then this time was now expiring,
        and the vision of the dream also disturbed him, Sabacos departed out of Egypt of his own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then when the Ethiopian had gone away out of Egypt, the blind man came back from the fen-country and began to
        rule again, having lived there during fifty years upon an island which he had made by heaping up ashes and
        earth: for whenever any of the Egyptians visited him bringing food, according as it had been appointed to them
        severally to do without the knowledge of the Ethiopian, he bade them bring also some ashes for their gift. This
        island none was able to find before Amyrtaios; that is, for more than seven hundred years the kings who arose
        before Amyrtaios were not able to find it. Now the name of this island is Elbo, and its size is ten furlongs
        each way.
    </p>
    <p>
        After him there came to the throne the priest of Hephaistos, whose name was Sethos. This man, they said,
        neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of
        them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from them the yokes of corn-land which had
        been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each man. After this,
        Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of
        the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a strait, entered into the
        sanctuary of the temple and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he
        was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him
        and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for
        he would himself send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of
        the Egyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came: and
        not one of the warrior class followed him, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they
        came, there swarmed by the night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their quivers and their bows,
        and moreover the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without defense of arms
        great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon
        his hand a mouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: “Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the
        gods.”
    </p>
    <p>
        So far in the story the Egyptians and the priests were they who made the report, declaring that from the first
        king down to this priest of Hephaistos who reigned last, there had been three hundred and forty-one generations
        of men, and that in them there had been the same number of chief-priests and of kings: but three hundred
        generations of men are equal to ten thousand years, for a hundred years is three generations of men; and in the
        one-and-forty generations which remain, those I mean which were added to the three hundred, there are one
        thousand three hundred and forty years. Thus in the period of eleven thousand three hundred and forty years they
        said that there had arisen no god in human form; nor even before that time or afterwards among the remaining
        kings who arose in Egypt, did they report that anything of that kind had come to pass. In this time they said
        that the sun had moved four times from his accustomed place of rising, and where he now sets he had thence twice
        had his rising, and in the place from whence he now rises he had twice had his setting; and in the meantime
        nothing in Egypt had been changed from its usual state, neither that which comes from the earth nor that which
        comes to them from the river nor that which concerns diseases or deaths. And formerly when Hecataios the
        historian was in Thebes, and had traced his descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth
        generation before, the priests of Zeus did for him much the same as they did for me (though I had not traced my
        descent). They led me into the sanctuary of the temple, which is of great size, and they counted up the number,
        showing colossal wooden statues in number the same as they said; for each chief-priest there sets up in his
        lifetime an image of himself: accordingly the priests, counting and showing me these, declared to me that each
        one of them was a son succeeding his own father, and they went up through the series of images from the image of
        the one who had died last, until they had declared this of the whole number. And when Hecataios had traced his
        descent and connected his family with a god in the sixteenth generation, they traced a descent in opposition to
        his, besides their numbering, not accepting it from him that a man had been born from a god; and they traced
        their counter-descent thus, saying that each one of the statues had been piromis son of piromis, until they had
        declared this of the whole three hundred and forty-five statues, each one being surnamed piromis; and neither
        with a god nor a hero did they connect their descent. Now piromis means in the tongue of Hellas “honourable and
        good man.” From their declaration then it followed, that they of whom the images were had been of form like
        this, and far removed from being gods: but in the time before these men they said that gods were the rulers in
        Egypt, not mingling with men, and that of these always one had power at a time; and the last of them who was
        king over Egypt was Oros the son of Osiris, whom the Hellenes call Apollo: he was king over Egypt last, having
        deposed Typhon. Now Osiris in the tongue of Hellas is Dionysos.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among the Hellenes Heracles, and Dionysos and Pan are accounted the latest-born of the gods; but with the
        Egyptians Pan is a very ancient god, and he is one of those which are called the eight gods, while Heracles is
        of the second rank, who are called the twelve gods, and Dionysos is of the third rank, namely of those who were
        born of the twelve gods. Now as to Heracles I have shown already how many years old he is according to the
        Egyptians themselves, reckoning down to the reign of Amasis, and Pan is said to have existed for yet more years
        than these, and Dionysos for the smallest number of years as compared with the others; and even for this last
        they reckon down to the reign of Amasis fifteen thousand years. This the Egyptians say that they know for a
        certainty, since they always kept a reckoning and wrote down the years as they came. Now the Dionysos who is
        said to have been born of Semele the daughter of Cadmos, was born about sixteen hundred years before my time,
        and Heracles who was the son of Alcmene, about nine hundred years, and that Pan who was born of Penelope, for of
        her and of Hermes Pan is said by the Hellenes to have been born, came into being later than the wars of Troy,
        about eight hundred years before my time. Of these two accounts every man may adopt that one which he shall find
        the more credible when he hears it. I however, for my part, have already declared my opinion about them. For if
        these also, like Heracles the son of Amphitryon, had appeared before all men’s eyes and had lived their lives to
        old age in Hellas, I mean Dionysos the son of Semele and Pan the son of Penelope, then one would have said that
        these also had been born mere men, having the names of those gods who had come into being long before: but as it
        is, with regard to Dionysos, the Hellenes say that as soon as he was born Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and
        carried him to Nysa, which is above Egypt in the land of Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they cannot say whither he
        went after he was born. Hence it has become clear to me that the Hellenes learnt the names of these gods later
        than those of the other gods, and trace their descent as if their birth occurred at the time when they first
        learnt their names.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus far then the history is told by the Egyptians themselves; but I will now recount that which other nations
        also tell, and the Egyptians in agreement with the others, of that which happened in this land: and there will
        be added to this also something of that which I have myself seen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being set free after the reign of the priest of Hephaistos, the Egyptians, since they could not live any time
        without a king, set up over them twelve kings, having divided all Egypt into twelve parts. These made
        intermarriages with one another and reigned, making agreement that they would not put down one another by force,
        nor seek to get an advantage over one another, but would live in perfect friendship: and the reason why they
        made these agreements, guarding them very strongly from violation, was this, namely that an oracle had been
        given to them at first when they began to exercise their rule, that he of them who should pour a libation with a
        bronze cup in the temple of Hephaistos, should be king of all Egypt (for they used to assemble together in all
        the temples). Moreover they resolved to join all together and leave a memorial of themselves; and having so
        resolved they caused to be made a labyrinth, situated a little above the lake of Moiris and nearly opposite to
        that which is called the City of Crocodiles. This I saw myself, and I found it greater than words can say. For
        if one should put together and reckon up all the buildings and all the great works produced by Hellenes, they
        would prove to be inferior in labour and expense to this labyrinth, though it is true that both the temple at
        Ephesos and that at Samos are works worthy of note. The pyramids also were greater than words can say, and each
        one of them is equal to many works of the Hellenes, great as they may be; but the labyrinth surpasses even the
        pyramids. It has twelve courts covered in, with gates facing one another, six upon the North side and six upon
        the South, joining on one to another, and the same wall surrounds them all outside; and there are in it two
        kinds of chambers, the one kind below the ground and the other above upon these, three thousand in number, of
        each kind fifteen hundred. The upper set of chambers we ourselves saw, going through them, and we tell of them
        having looked upon them with our own eyes; but the chambers under ground we heard about only; for the Egyptians
        who had charge of them were not willing on any account to show them, saying that here were the sepulchres of the
        kings who had first built this labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles. Accordingly we speak of the chambers
        below by what we received form hearsay, while those above we saw ourselves and found them to be works of more
        than human greatness. For the passages through the chambers, and the goings this way and that way through the
        courts, which were admirably adorned, afforded endless matter for marvel, as we went through from a court to the
        chambers beyond it, and from the chambers to colonnades, and from the colonnades to other rooms, and then from
        the chambers again to other courts. Over the whole of these is a roof made of stone like the walls; and the
        walls are covered with figures carved upon them, each court being surrounded with pillars of white stone fitted
        together most perfectly; and at the end of the labyrinth, by the corner of it, there is a pyramid of forty
        fathoms, upon which large figures are carved, and to this there is a way made under ground.
