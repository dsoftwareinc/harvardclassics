                <p>This the month, and this the happy morn,</p>
                <p>Wherein the Son of Heaven's eternal King,</p>
                <p>Of wedded maid and Virgin Mother born,</p>
                <p>Our great redemption from above did bring;</p>
                <p>For so the holy sages once did sing,</p>
                <p>That he our deadly forfeit should release,</p>
                <p>And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.</p>

                <p>That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,</p>
                <p>And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,</p>
                <p>Wherewith he wont at Heaven's high council-table</p>
                <p>To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,</p>
                <p>He laid aside, and, here with us to be,</p>
                <p>Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,</p>
                <p>And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.</p>

                <p>Afford a present to the Infant God?</p>
                <p>Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,</p>

                <p>The star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet!</p>
                <p>Oh! run; prevent them with thy humble ode,</p>

        <h2>A PARAPHRASE ON PSALM CXIV (1624)</h2>

            <p>When the blest seed of Terah's faithful Son</p>
            <p>After long toil their liberty had won,</p>
            <p>And passed from Pharian fields to Canaan Land,</p>
            <p>Led by the strength of the Almighty's hand,</p>
            <p>Jehovah's wonders were in Israel shown,</p>
            <p>His praise and glory was in Israel known.</p>
            <p>That saw the troubled sea, and shivering fled,</p>
            <p>And sought to hide his froth-becurled head</p>
            <p>Low in the earth; Jordan's clear streams recoil,</p>
            <p>As a faint host that hath received the foil.</p>
            <p>The high huge-bellied mountains skip like rams</p>
            <p>Amongst their ewes, the litde hills like lambs.</p>
            <p>Why fled the ocean? and why skipped the mountains?</p>
            <p>Why turned Jordan toward his crystal fountains?</p>
            <p>Shake, Earth, and at the presence be aghast</p>
            <p>Of Him that ever was and aye shall last,</p>
            <p>That glassy floods from rugged rocks can crush,</p>
            <p>And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush.</p>
