        ON a superficial view, we may seem to differ very widely from each other in our reasonings, and no less in our
        pleasures: but notwithstanding this difference, which I think to be rather apparent than real, it is probable
        that the standard both of reason and taste is the same in all human creatures. For if there were not some
        principles of judgment as well as of sentiment common to all mankind, no hold could possibly be taken either on
        their reason or their passions, sufficient to maintain the ordinary correspondence of life. It appears indeed to
        be generally acknowledged, that with regard to truth and falsehood there is something fixed. We find people in
        their disputes continually appealing to certain tests and standards, which are allowed on all sides, and are
        supposed to be established in our common nature. But there is not the same obvious concurrence in any uniform or
        settled principles which relate to taste. It is even commonly supposed that this delicate and aerial faculty,
        which seems too volatile to endure even the chains of a definition, cannot be properly tried by any test, nor
        regulated by any standard. There is so continual a call for the exercise of the reasoning faculty, and it is so
        much strengthened by perpetual contention, that certain maxims of right reason seem to be tacitly settled
        amongst the most ignorant. The learned have improved on this rude science, and reduced those maxims into a
        system. If taste has not been so happily cultivated, it was not that the subject was barren, but that the
        labourers were few or negligent; for, to say the truth, there are not the same interesting motives to impel us
        to fix the one, which urge us to ascertain the other. And, after all, if men differ in their opinion concerning
        such matters, their difference is not attended with the same important consequences; else I make no doubt but
        that the logic of taste, if I may be allowed the expression, might very possibly be as well digested, and we
        might come to discuss matters of this nature with as much certainty, as those which seem more immediately within
        the province of mere reason. And indeed, it is very necessary, at the entrance into such an inquiry as our
        present, to make this point as clear as possible; for if taste has no fixed principles, if the imagination is
        not affected according to some invariable and certain laws, our labour is likely to be employed to very little
        purpose; as it must be judged a useless, if not an absurd undertaking, to lay down rules for caprice, and to set
        up for a legislator of whims and fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term taste, like all other figurative terms, is not extremely accurate; the thing which we understand by it
        is far from a simple and determinate idea in the minds of most men, and it is therefore liable to uncertainty
        and confusion. I have no great opinion of a definition, the celebrated remedy for the cure of this disorder.
        For, when we define, we seem in danger of circumscribing nature within the bounds of our own notions, which we
        often take up by hazard, or embrace on trust, or form out of a limited and partial consideration of the object
        before us; instead of extending our ideas to take in all that nature comprehends, according to her manner of
        combining. We are limited in our inquiry by the strict laws to which we have submitted at our setting out. <br/>
        â€”Circa vilem patulumque morabimur orbem, <br/>
        Unde pudor proferre pedem vetat aut operis lex.
    </p>
    <p>
        A definition may be very exact, and yet go but a very little way towards informing us of the nature of the thing
        defined; but let the virtue of a definition be what it will, in the order of things, it seems rather to follow
        than to precede our inquiry, of which it ought to be considered as the result. It must be acknowledged, that the
        methods of disquisition and teaching may be sometimes different, and on very good reason undoubtedly; but, for
        my part, I am convinced that the method of teaching which approaches most nearly to the method of investigation
        is incomparably the best; since, not content with serving up a few barren and lifeless truths, it leads to the
        stock on which they grew; it tends to set the reader himself in the track of invention, and to direct him into
        those paths in which the author has made his own discoveries, if he should be so happy as to have made any that
        are valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
        But to cut off all pretence for cavilling, I mean by the word Taste no more than that faculty or those faculties
        of the mind, which are affected with, or which form a judgment of, the works of imagination and the elegant
        arts. This is, I think the most general idea of that word, and what is the least connected with any particular
        theory. And my point in this inquiry is, to find whether there are any principles, on which the imagination is
        affected, so common to all, so grounded and certain, as to supply the means of reasoning satisfactorily about
        them. And such principles of taste I fancy there are; however paradoxical it may seem to those, who on a
        superficial view imagine, that there is so great a diversity of tastes, both in kind and degree, that nothing
        can be more indeterminate.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the natural powers in man, which I know, that are conversant about external objects, are the senses; the
        imagination; and the judgment. And first with regard to the senses. We do and we must suppose, that as the
        conformation of their organs is nearly or altogether the same in all men, so the manner of perceiving external
        objects is in all men the same, or with little difference. We are satisfied that what appears to be light to one
        eye, appears light to another; that what seems sweet to one palate, is sweet to another; that what is dark and
        bitter to this man, is likewise dark and bitter to that; and we conclude in the same manner of great and little,
        hard and soft, hot and cold, rough and smooth, and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies.
        If we suffer ourselves to imagine, that their senses present to different men different images of things, this
        sceptical proceeding will make every sort of reasoning on every subject vain and frivolous, even that sceptical
        reasoning itself which had persuaded us to entertain a doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions. But as
        there will be little doubt that bodies present similar images to the whole species, it must necessarily be
        allowed, that the pleasures and the pains which every object excites in one man, it must raise in all mankind,
        whilst it operates naturally, simply, and by its proper powers only; for if we deny this, we must imagine that
        the same cause, operating in the same manner, and on subjects of the same kind, will produce different effects;
        which would be highly absurd. Let us first consider this point in the sense of taste, and the rather, as the
        faculty in question has taken its name from that sense. All men are agreed to call vinegar sour, honey sweet,
        and aloes bitter; and as they are all agreed in finding these qualities in those objects, they do not in the
        least differ concerning their effects with regard to pleasure and pain. They all concur in calling sweetness
        pleasant, and sourness and bitterness unpleasant. Here there is no diversity in their sentiments; and that there
        is not, appears fully from the consent of all men in the metaphors which are taken from the sense of taste. A
        sour temper, bitter expressions, bitter curses, a bitter fate, are terms well and strongly understood by all.
        And we are altogether as well understood when we say, a sweet disposition, a sweet person, a sweet condition,
        and the like. It is confessed, that custom and some other causes have made many deviations from the natural
        pleasures or pains which belong to these several tastes: but then the power of distinguishing between the
        natural and the acquired relish remains to the very last. A man frequently comes to prefer the taste of tobacco
        to that of sugar, and the flavour of vinegar to that of milk; but this makes no confusion in tastes, whilst he
        is sensible that the tobacco and vinegar are not sweet, and whilst he knows that habit alone has reconciled his
        palate to these alien pleasures. Even with such a person we may speak, and with sufficient precision, concerning
        tastes. But should any man be found who declares, that to him tobacco has a taste like sugar, and that he cannot
        distinguish between milk and vinegar; or that tobacco and vinegar are sweet, milk bitter, and sugar sour; we
        immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order, and that his palate is utterly vitiated. We
        are as far from conferring with such a person upon tastes, as from reasoning concerning the relations of
        quantity with one who should deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole. We do not call a man of
        this kind wrong in his notions, but absolutely mad. Exceptions of this sort, in either way, do not at all
        impeach our general rule, nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the relations of
        quantity or the taste of things. So that when it is said, taste cannot be disputed, it can only mean, that no
        one can strictly answer what pleasure or pain some particular man may find from the taste of some particular
        thing. This indeed cannot be disputed; but we may dispute, and with sufficient clearness too, concerning the
        things which are naturally pleasing or disagreeable to the sense. But when we talk of any peculiar or acquired
        relish, then we must know the habits, the prejudices, or the distempers of this particular man, and we must draw
        our conclusion from those.
    </p>
    <p>
        This agreement of mankind is not confined to the taste solely. The principle of pleasure derived from sight is
        the same in all. Light is more pleasing than darkness. Summer, when the earth is clad in green, when the heavens
        are serene and bright, is more agreeable than winter, when everything makes a different appearance. I never
        remember that anything beautiful, whether a man, a beast, a bird, or a plant, was ever shown, though it were to
        a hundred people, that they did not all immediately agree that it was beautiful, though some might have thought
        that it fell short of their expectation, or that other things were still finer. I believe no man thinks a goose
        to be more beautiful than a swan, or imagines that what they call a Friesland hen excels a peacock. It must be
        observed, too, that the pleasures of the sight are not near so complicated, and confused, and altered by
        unnatural habits and associations, as the pleasures of the taste are; because the pleasures of the sight more
        commonly acquiesce in themselves; and are not so often altered by considerations which are independent of the
        sight itself. But things do not spontaneously present themselves to the palate as they do to the sight; they are
        generally applied to it, either as food or as medicine; and, from the qualities which they possess for nutritive
        or medicinal purposes, they often form the palate by degrees, and by force of these associations. Thus opium is
        pleasing to Turks, on account of the agreeable delirium it produces. Tobacco is the delight of Dutchmen, as it
        diffuses a torpor and pleasing stupefaction. Fermented spirits please our common people, because they banish
        care, and all consideration of future or present evils. All of these would lie absolutely neglected if their
        properties had originally gone no further than the taste; but all these together, with tea and coffee, and some
        other things, have passed from the apothecaryâ€™s shop to our tables, and were taken for health long before they
        were thought of for pleasure. The effect of the drug has made us use it frequently; and frequent use, combined
        with the agreeable effect, has made the taste itself at last agreeable. But this does not in the least perplex
        our reasoning; because we distinguish to the last the acquired from the natural relish. In describing the taste
        of an unknown fruit, you would scarcely say that it had a sweet and pleasant flavour like tobacco, opium, or
        garlic, although you spoke to those who were in the constant use of these drugs, and had great pleasure in them.
        There is in all men sufficient remembrance of the original natural causes of pleasure, to enable them to bring
        all things offered to their senses to that standard, and to regulate their feelings and opinions by it. Suppose
        one who had so vitiated his palate as to take more pleasure in the taste of opium than in that of butter or
        honey, to be presented with a bolus of squills; there is hardly any doubt but that he would prefer the butter or
        honey to this nauseous morsel, or to any bitter drug to which he had not been accustomed; which proves that his
        palate was naturally like that of other men in all things, that it is still like the palate of other men in many
        things, and only vitiated in some particular points. For in judging of any new thing, even of a taste similar to
        that which he has been formed by habit to like, he finds his palate affected in a natural manner, and on the
        common principles. Thus the pleasure of all the senses, of the sight, and even of the taste, that most ambiguous
        of the senses, is the same in all, high and low, learned and unlearned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the ideas, with their annexed pains and pleasures, which are presented by the sense; the mind of man
        possesses a sort of creative power of its own; either in representing at pleasure the images of things in the
        order and manner in which they were received by the senses, or in combining those images in a new manner, and
        according to a different order. This power is called imagination; and to this belongs whatever is called wit,
        fancy, invention, and the like. But it must be observed, that this power of the imagination is incapable of
        producing anything absolutely new; it can only vary the disposition of those ideas which it has received from
        the senses. Now the imagination is the most extensive province of pleasure and pain, as it is the region of our
        fears and our hopes, and of all our passions that are connected with them; and whatever is calculated to affect
        the imagination with these commanding ideas, by force of any original natural impression, must have the same
        power pretty equally over all men. For since the imagination is only the representation of the senses, it can
        only be pleased or displeased with the images, from the same principle on which the sense is pleased or
        displeased with the realities; and consequently there must be just as close an agreement in the imaginations as
        in the senses of men. A little attention will convince us that this must of necessity be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        But in the imagination, besides the pain or pleasure arising from the properties of the natural object, a
        pleasure is perceived from the resemblance which the imitation has to the original: the imagination, I conceive,
        can have no pleasure but what results from one or other of these causes. And these causes operate pretty
        uniformly upon all men, because they operate by principles in nature, and which are not derived from any
        particular habits or advantages. Mr. Locke very justly and finely observes of wit, that it is chiefly conversant
        in tracing resemblances: he remarks, at the same time, that the business of judgment is rather in finding
        differences. It may perhaps appear, on this supposition, that there is no material distinction between the wit
        and the judgment, as they both seem to result from different operations of the same faculty of comparing. But in
        reality, whether they are or are not dependent on the same power of the mind, they differ so very materially in
        many respects, that a perfect union of wit and judgment is one of the rarest things in the world. When two
        distinct objects are unlike to each other, it is only what we expect; things are in their common way; and
        therefore they make no impression on the imagination: but when two distinct objects have a resemblance, we are
        struck, we attend to them, and we are pleased. The mind of man has naturally a far greater alacrity and
        satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in searching for differences: because by making resemblances we
        produce new images; we unite, we create, we enlarge our stock; but in making distinctions we offer no food at
        all to the imagination; the task itself is more severe and irksome, and what pleasure we derive from it is
        something of a negative and indirect nature. A piece of news is told me in the morning; this, merely as a piece
        of news, as a fact added to my stock, gives me some pleasure. In the evening I find there was nothing in it.
        What do I gain by this, but the dissatisfaction to find that I have been imposed upon? Hence it is that men are
        much more naturally inclined to belief than to incredulity. And it is upon this principle, that the most
        ignorant and barbarous nations have frequently excelled in similitudes, comparisons, metaphors, and allegories,
        who have been weak and backward in distinguishing and sorting their ideas. And it is for a reason of this kind,
        that Homer and the Oriental writers, though very fond of similitudes, and though they often strike out such as
        are truly admirable, seldom take care to have them exact; that is, they are taken with the general resemblance,
        they paint it strongly, and they take no notice of the difference which may be found between the things
        compared.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, as the pleasure of resemblance is that which principally flatters the imagination, all men are nearly equal
        in this point, as far as their knowledge of the things represented or compared extends. The principle of this
        knowledge is very much accidental, as it depends upon experience and observation, and not on the strength or
        weakness of any natural faculty; and it is from this difference in knowledge, that what we commonly, though with
        no great exactness, call a difference in taste proceeds. A man to whom sculp ture is new, sees a barberâ€™s block,
        or some ordinary piece of statuary, he is immediately struck and pleased, because he sees something like a human
        figure; and, entirely taken up with this likeness, he does not at all attend to its defects. No person, I
        believe, at the first time of seeing a piece of imitation ever did. Some time after, we suppose that this novice
        lights upon a more artificial work of the same nature; he now begins to look with contempt on what he admired at
        first; not that he admired it even then for its unlikeness to a man, but for that general, though inaccurate,
        resemblance which it bore to the human figure. What he admired at different times in these so different figures,
        is strictly the same; and though his knowledge is improved, his taste is not altered. Hitherto his mistake was
        from a want of knowledge in art; and this arose from his inexperience; but he may be still deficient from a want
        of knowledge in nature. For it is possible that the man in question may stop here, and that the masterpiece of a
        great hand may please him no more than the middling performance of a vulgar artist: and this not for want of
        better or higher relish, but because all men do not observe with sufficient accuracy on the human figure to
        enable them to judge properly of an imitation of it. And that the critical taste does not depend upon a superior
        principle in men, but upon superior knowledge, may appear from several instances. The story of the ancient
        painter and the shoemaker is very well known. The shoemaker set the painter right with regard to some mistakes
        he had made in the shoe of one of his figures, and which the painter, who had not made such accurate
        observations on shoes, and was content with a general resemblance, had never observed. But this was no
        impeachment to the taste of the painter; it only showed some want of knowledge in the art of making shoes. Let
        us imagine, that an anatomist had come into the painterâ€™s working-room. His piece is in general well done, the
        figure in question in a good attitude, and the parts well adjusted to their various movements; yet the
        anatomist, critical in his art, may observe the swell of some muscle not quite just in the peculiar action of
        the figure. Here the anatomist observes what the painter had not observed; and he passes by what the shoemaker
        had remarked. But a want of the last critical knowledge in anatomy no more reflected on the natural good taste
        of the painter or of any common observer of his piece, than the want of an exact knowledge in the formation of a
        shoe. A fine piece of a decollated head of St. John the Baptist was shown to a Turkish emperor; he praised many
        things, but he observed one defect; he observed that the skin did not shrink from the wounded part of the neck.
        The sultan on this occasion, though his observation was very just, discovered no more natural taste than the
        painter who executed this piece, or than a thousand European connoisseurs, who probably never would have made
        the same observation. His Turkish Majesty had indeed been well acquainted with that terrible spectacle, which
        the others could only have represented in their imagination. On the subject of their dislike there is a
        difference between all these people, arising from the different kinds and degrees of their knowledge; but there
        is something in common to the painter, the shoemaker, the anatomist, and the Turkish emperor, the pleasure
        arising from a natural object, so far as each perceives it justly imitated; the satisfaction in seeing an
        agreeable figure; the sympathy proceeding from a striking and affecting incident. So far as taste is natural, it
        is nearly common to all.
    </p>
    <p>
        In poetry, and other pieces of imagination, the same parity may be observed. It is true, that one man is charmed
        with Don Bellianis, and reads Virgil coldly; whilst another is transported with the Eneid, and leaves Don
        Bellianis to children. These two men seem to have a taste very different from each other; but in fact they
        differ very little. In both these pieces, which inspire such opposite sentiments, a tale exciting admiration is
        told; both are full of action, both are passionate; in both are voyages, battles, triumphs, and continual
        changes of fortune. The admirer of Don Bellianis perhaps does not understand the refined language of the Eneid,
        who, if it was degraded into the style of the Pilgrimâ€™s Progress, might feel it in all its energy, on the same
        principle which made him an admirer of Don Bellianis.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his favourite author he is not shocked with the continual breaches of probability, the confusion of times,
        the offences against manners, the trampling upon geography; for he knows nothing of geography and chronology,
        and he has never examined the grounds of probability. He perhaps reads of a shipwreck on the coast of Bohemia;
        wholly taken up with so interesting an event, and only solicitous for the fate of his hero, he is not in the
        least troubled at this extravagant blunder. For why should he be shocked at a shipwreck on the coast of Bohemia,
        who does not know but that Bohemia may be an island in the Atlantic ocean? and after all, what reflection is
        this on the natural good taste of the person here supposed?
    </p>
    <p>
        So far then as taste belongs to the imagination, its principle is the same in all men; there is no difference in
        the manner of their being affected, nor in the causes of the affection; but in the degree there is a difference,
        which arises from two causes principally; either from a greater degree of natural sensibility, or from a closer
        and longer attention to the object. To illustrate this by the procedure of the senses, in which the same
        difference is found, let us suppose a very smooth marble table to be set before two men; they both perceive it
        to be smooth; and they are both pleased with it because of this quality. So far they agree. But suppose another,
        and after that another table, the latter still smoother than the former, to be set before them. It is now very
        probable that these men, who are so agreed upon what is smooth, and in the pleasure from thence, will disagree
        when they come to settle which table has the advantage in point of polish. Here is indeed the great difference
        between tastes, when men come to compare the excess or diminution of things which are judged by degree and not
        by measure. Nor is it easy, when such a difference arises, to settle the point, if the excess or diminution be
        not glaring. If we differ in opinion about two quantities, we can have recourse to a common measure, which may
        decide the question with the utmost exactness; and this, I take it, is what gives mathematical knowledge a
        greater certainty than any other. But in things whose excess is not judged by greater or smaller, as smoothness
        and roughness, hardness and softness, darkness and light, the shades of colours, all these are very easily
        distinguished when the difference is any way considerable, but not when it is minute, for want of some common
        measures, which perhaps may never come to be discovered. In these nice cases, supposing the acuteness of the
        sense equal, the greater attention and habit in such things will have the advantage. In the question about the
        tables, the marble-polisher will unquestionably determine the most accurately. But notwithstanding this want of
        a common measure for settling many disputes relative to the senses, and their representative the imagination, we
        find that the principles are the same in all, and that there is no disagreement until we come to examine into
        the pre-eminence or difference of things, which brings us within the province of the judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        So long as we are conversant with the sensible qualities of things, hardly any more than the imagination seems
        concerned; little more also than the imagination seems concerned when the passions are represented, because by
        the force of natural sympathy they are felt in all men without any recourse to reasoning, and their justness
        recognized in every breast. Love, grief, fear, anger, joy, all these passions have, in their turns, affected
        every mind; and they do not affect it in an arbitrary or casual manner, but upon certain, natural, and uniform
        principles. But as many of the works of imagination are not confined to the representation of sensible objects,
        nor to efforts upon the passions, but extend themselves to the manners, the characters, the actions, and designs
        of men, their relations, their virtues, and vices, they come within the province of the judgment, which is
        improved by attention, and by the habit of reasoning. All these make a very considerable part of what are
        considered as the objects of taste; and Horace sends us to the schools of philosophy and the world for our
        instruction in them. Whatever certainty is to be acquired in morality and the science of life; just the same
        degree of certainty have we in what relates to them in the works of imitation. Indeed it is for the most part in
        our skill in manners, and in the observances of time and place, and of decency in general, which is only to be
        learned in those schools to which Horace recommends us, that what is called taste, by way of distinction,
        consists; and which is in reality no other than a more refined judgment. On the whole it appears to me, that
        what is called taste, in its most general acceptation, is not a simple idea, but is partly made up of a
        perception of the primary pleasures of sense, of the secondary pleasures of the imagination, and of the
        conclusions of the reasoning faculty, concerning the various relations to these, and concerning the human
        passions, manners, and actions. All this is requisite to form taste, and the ground-work of all these is the
        same in the human mind; for as the senses are the great originals of all our ideas, and consequently of all our
        pleasures, if they are not uncertain and arbitrary, the whole ground-work of taste is common to all, and
        therefore there is a sufficient foundation for a conclusive reasoning on these matters.

        Whilst we consider taste merely according to its nature and species, we shall find its principles entirely
        uniform; but the degree in which these principles prevail in the several individuals of mankind, is altogether
        as different as the principles themselves are similar. For sensibility and judgment, which are the qualities
        that compose what we commonly call a taste, vary exceedingly in various people. From a defect in the former of
        these qualities arises a want of taste; a weakness in the latter constitutes a wrong or a bad one. There are
        some men formed with feelings so blunt, with tempers so cold and phlegmatic, that they can hardly be said to be
        awake during the whole course of their lives. Upon such persons the most striking objects make but a faint and
        obscure impression. There are others so continually in the agitation of gross and merely sensual pleasures, or
        so occupied in the low drudgery of avarice, or so heated in the chase of honours and distinction, that their
        minds, which had been used continually to the storms of these violent and tempestuous passions, can hardly be
        put in motion by the delicate and refined play of the imagination. These men, though from a different cause,
        become as stupid and insensible as the former; but whenever either of these happen to be struck with any natural
        elegance or greatness, or with these qualities in any work of art, they are moved upon the same principle.

        The cause of a wrong taste is a defect of judgment. And this may arise from a natural weakness of understanding,
        (in whatever the strength of that faculty may consist,) or, which is much more commonly the case, it may arise
        from a want of proper and well-directed exercise, which alone can make it strong and ready. Besides that
        ignorance, inattention, prejudice, rashness, levity, obstinacy, in short, all those passions, and all those
        vices, which pervert the judgment in other matters, prejudice it no less in this its more refined and elegant
        province. These causes produce different opinions upon everything which is an object of the understanding,
        without inducing us to suppose that there are no settled principles of reason. And indeed, on the whole, one may
        observe that there is rather less difference upon matters of taste among mankind, than upon most of those which
        depend upon the naked reason; and that men are far better agreed on the excellency of a description in Virgil,
        than on the truth or falsehood of a theory of Aristotle.

        A rectitude of judgment in the arts, which may be called a good taste, does in a great measure depend upon
        sensibility; because, if the mind has no bent to the pleasures of the imagination, it will never apply itself
        sufficiently to works of that species to acquire a competent knowledge in them. But, though a degree of
        sensibility is requisite to form a good judgment, yet a good judgment does not necessarily arise from a quick
        sensibility of pleasure; it frequently happens that a very poor judge, merely by force of a greater complexional
        sensibility, is more affected by a very poor piece, than the best judge by the most perfect; for as everything
        new, extraordinary, grand, or passionate, is well calculated to affect such a person, and that the faults do not
        affect him, his pleasure is more pure and unmixed; and as it is merely a pleasure of the imagination, it is much
        higher than any which is derived from a rectitude of the judgment; the judgment is for the greater part employed
        in throwing stumbling-blocks in the way of the imagination, in dissipating the scenes of its enchantment, and in
        tying us down to the disagreeable yoke of our reason: for almost the only pleasure that men have in judging
        better than others, consists in a sort of conscious pride and superiority, which arises from thinking rightly;
        but then, this is an indirect pleasure, a pleasure which does not immediately result from the object which is
        under contemplation. In the morning of our days, when the senses are unworn and tender, when the whole man is
        awake in every part, and the gloss of novelty fresh upon all the objects that surround us, how lively at that
        time are our sensations, but how false and inaccurate the judgments we form of things? I despair of ever
        receiving the same degree of pleasure from the most excellent performances of genius, which I felt at that age
        from pieces which my present judgment regards as trifling and contemptible. Every trivial cause of pleasure is
        apt to affect the man of too sanguine a complexion: his appetite is too keen to suffer his taste to be delicate;
        and he is in all respects what Ovid says of himself in love, <br/>
        Molle meum levibus cor est violabile telis, <br/>
        Et semper causa est, cur ego semper amem.

        One of this character can never be a refined judge; never what the comic poet calls elegans formarum spectator.
        The excellence and force of a composition must always be imperfectly estimated from its effect on the minds of
        any, except we know the temper and character of those minds. The most powerful effects of poetry and music have
        been displayed, and perhaps are still displayed, where these arts are but in a very low and imperfect state. The
        rude hearer is affected by the principles which operate in these arts even in their rudest condition; and he is
        not skillful enough to perceive the defects. But as the arts advance towards their perfection, the science of
        criticism advances with equal pace, and the pleasure of judges is frequently interrupted by the faults which are
        discovered in the most finished compositions.

        Before I leave this subject I cannot help taking notice of an opinion which many persons entertain, as if the
        taste were a separate faculty of the mind, and distinct from the judgment and imagination; a species of
        instinct, by which we are struck naturally, and at the first glance, without any previous reasoning, with the
        excellencies, or the defects, of a composition. So far as the imagination and the passions are concerned, I
        believe it true, that the reason is little consulted; but where disposition, where decorum, where congruity are
        concerned, in short, wherever the best taste differs from the worst, I am convinced that the understanding
        operates, and nothing else; and its operation is in reality far from being always sudden, or, when it is sudden,
        it is often far from being right. Men of the best taste, by consideration, come frequently to change these early
        and precipitate judgments, which the mind, from its aversion to neutrality and doubt, loves to form on the spot.
        It is known that the taste (whatever it is) is improved exactly as we improve our judgment, by extending our
        knowledge, by a steady attention to our object, and by frequent exercise. They who have not taken these methods,
        if their taste decides quickly, it is always uncertainly; and their quickness is owing to their presumption and
        rashness, and not to any sudden irradiation, that in a moment dispels all darkness from their minds. But they
        who have cultivated that species of knowledge which makes the object of taste, by degrees, and habitually,
        attain not only a soundness, but a readiness of judgment, as men do by the same methods on all other occasions.
        At first they are obliged to spell, but at least they read with ease and with celerity; but this celerity of its
        operation is no proof that the taste is a distinct faculty. Nobody, I believe, has attended the course of a
        discussion, which turned upon matters within the sphere of mere naked reason, but must have observed the extreme
        readiness with which the whole process of the argument is carried on, the grounds discovered, the objections
        raised and answered, and the conclusions drawn from premises, with a quickness altogether as great as the taste
        can be supposed to work with; and yet where nothing but plain reason either is or can be suspected to operate.
        To multiply principles for every different appearance, is useless, and unphilosophical too in a high degree.

        This matter might be pursued much further; but it is not the extent of the subject which must prescribe our
        bounds, for what subject does not branch out to infinity? It is the nature of our particular scheme, and the
        single point of view in which we consider it, which ought to put a stop to our researches.
