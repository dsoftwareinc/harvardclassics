        The Federalist, No. I <br/>
        By Alexander Hamilton
    </p>
    <p>
        To the People of the State of New York:<br/>
        AFTER an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting Federal Government, you are called upon to
        deliverate on a new Constitution for the United States of America. The subject speaks its own importance;
        comprehending in its consequences, nothing less than the existence of the UNION, the safety and welfare of the
        parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire, in many respects, the most interesting in the world. It
        has been frequently remarked, that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country, by their
        conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not, of
        establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend, for
        their political constitutions, on accident and force. If there be any truth in the remark, the crisis, at which
        we are arrived, may with propriety be regarded as the area in which that decision is to be made; and a wrong
        election of the part we shall act, may, in this view, deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of
        mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
        This idea will add the inducements of philanthropy to those of patriotism to heighten the solicitude, which all
        considerate and good men must feel for the event. Happy will it be if our choice should be directed by a
        judicious estimate of our true interests, unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the
        public good. But this is a thing more ardently to be wished, than seriously to be expected. The plan offered to
        our deliberations, affects too many particular interest, innovates upon too many local institutions, not to
        involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits, and of views, passions and prejudices
        little favorable to the discovery of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among the most formidable of the obstacles which the new Constitution will have to encounter, may readily be
        distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every State to resist all changes which may
        hazard a diminution of the power, emolument and consequence of the offices they hold under the
        State—establishments—and the perverted ambition of another class of men, who will either hope to aggrandize
        themselves by the confusion of their country, or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from
        the subdivision of the empire into several partial confederacies, than from its union under one Government.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not, however, my design to dwell upon observations of this nature. I am well aware that it would be
        disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the opposition of any set of men (merely because their situations might
        subject them to suspicion) into interested or ambitious views: Candor will oblige us to admit, that even such
        men may be actuated by upright intentions; and it cannot be doubted, that much of the opposition which has made
        its appearance, or may hereafter make its appearance, will spring from sources, blameless at least, if not
        respectable; the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears. So numerous indeed and
        so powerful are the causes, which serve to give a false bias to the judgment, that we, upon many occasions, see
        wise and good men on the wrong as well as on the right side of questions, of the first magnitude to society.
        This circumstance, if duly attended to, would furnish a lesson of moderation to those, who are ever so much
        persuaded of their being in the right, in any controversy. And a further reason for caution, in this respect,
        might be drawn from the reflection, that we are not always sure, that those who advocate the truth are
        influenced by purer principles than their antagonists. Ambition, avarice, personal animosity, party opposition,
        and many other motives, not more laudable than these, are apt to operate as well upon those who support, as upon
        those who oppose, the right side of a question. Were there not even these inducements to moderation, nothing
        could be more ill—judged than that intolerant spirit, which has, at all times, characterized political parties.
        For, in politics as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in
        either can rarely be cured by persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet however just these sentiments will be allowed to be, we have already sufficient indications, that it
        will happen in this as in all former cases of great national discussion. A torrent of angry and malignant
        passions will be let loose. To judge from the conduct of the opposite parties, we shall be led to conclude, that
        they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions, and to increase the number of their converts
        by the loudness of their declamations, and the bitterness of their invectives. An enlightened, zeal for the
        energy and efficiency of government will be stigmatized, as the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power,
        and hostile to the principles of liberty. An over scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the people,
        which is more commonly the fault of the head than of the heart, will be represented as mere pretence and
        artifice; the stale bait for popularity at the expense of public good. It will be forgotten, on the one hand,
        that jealousy is the usual concomitant of violent love, and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is too apt to
        be infected with a spirit of narrow and illiberal distrust. On the other hand, it will be equally forgotten,
        that the vigor of Government is essential to the security of liberty; that, in the contemplation of a sound and
        well—informed judgment, their interest can never be separated; and that a dangerous ambition more often lurks
        behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding appearance of zeal for
        the firmness and efficiency of Government. History will teach us, that the former has been found a much certain
        road to the introduction of despotism, than the latter; and that of those men who have over turned the liberties
        of republics the greatest number have begun their career, by paying an obsequious court to the people;
        commencing Demagogues, and ending Tyrants.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the course of the preceding observations I have had an eye, my Fellow—Citizens, to putting you upon your
        guard against all attempts, from whatever quarter, to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment
        to your welfare by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth. You will, no
        doubt, at the same time, have collected from the general scope of them that they proceed from a source not
        unfriendly to the new Constitution. Yes, my Countrymen, I owe to you, that, after having given it an attentive
        consideration, I am clearly of opinion, it is your interest to adopt it. I am convinced, that this is the safest
        course for your liberty, your dignity, and your happiness. I affect not reserves, which I do not feel. I will
        amuse you with an appearance of deliberation, when I have decided. I frankly acknowledge to you my convictions,
        and I will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded. The consciousness of good intentions
        disdains ambiguity. I shall not however multiply professions on this head. My motives must remain in the
        depository of my own breast: My arguments will be open to all, and may be judged of by all. They shall at least
        be offered in a spirit which will not disgrace the cause of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
        I propose, in a series of papers, to discuss the following interesting particulars.—The utility of the UNION to
        your political prosperity—The insufficiency of the present Confederation to preserve that Union—The necessity of
        a Government at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to the attainment of this object—The conformity
        of the proposed Constitution to the true principles of republican Government—Its analogy to your own State
        Constitution—and lastly, The additional security which its adoption will afford to the preservation of that
        species of Government, to liberty, and to property.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the progress of this discussion, I shall endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which
        shall have made their appearance, that may seem to have any claim to your attention.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may perhaps be thought superfluous to offer arguments to prove the utility of the UNION, a point, no doubt,
        deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of the people in every State, and one, which it may be imagined,
        has no adversaries. But the fact is, that we already hear it whispered in the private circles of those who
        oppose the new Constitution, that the Thirteen States are of too great extent for any general system, and that
        we must of necessity, resort to separate confederacies of distinct portions of the whole. This doctrine will, in
        all probability, be gradually propagated, till it has votaries enough to countenance an open avowal of it. For
        nothing can be more evident, to those who are able to take an enlarged view of the subject, than the alternative
        of an adoption of the new Constitution or a dismemberment of the Union. It will, therefore, be of use to begin
        by examining the advantages of that Union, the certain evils, and the probable dangers, to which every State
        will be exposed from its dissolution. This shall accordingly constitute the subject of my next address.

        The Federalist, No. II <br/>
        By John Jay
    </p>
    <p>
        To the People of the State of New York:
    </p>
    <p>
        When the people of America reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question, which, in its
        consequences, must prove one of the most important, that ever engaged their attention, the propriety of their
        taking a very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it, will be evident.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that
        whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest
        it with requisite powers. It is well worthy of consideration, therefore, whether it would conduce more to the
        interest of the people of America, that they should, to all general purposes, be one nation, under one Federal
        Government, or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies, and give to the head of each, the
        same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national Government.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of America
        depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes, prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest Citizens
        have been constantly directed to that object. But Politicians now appear, who insist that this opinion is
        erroneous, and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union, we ought to seek it in a division of
        the States into distinct confederacies or sovereignties. However extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it
        nevertheless has its advocates; and certain characters who were much opposed to it formerly, are at present of
        the number. Whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and
        declarations of these Gentlemen, it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to adopt these new
        political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and sound Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has often given me pleasure to observe, that Independent America was not composed of detached and distant
        territories, but that one connected, fertile, wide—spreading country was the portion of our western sons of
        liberty. Providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions and watered it
        with innumerable streams, for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants. A succession of navigable waters
        forms a kind of chain round its borders, as if to bind it together; while the most noble rivers in the world,
        running at convenient distances, present them with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids, and the
        mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities.
    </p>
    <p>
        With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice, that Providence has been pleased to give this one connected
        country, to one united people; a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,
        professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and
        customs, and who, by their joint counsels, arms and efforts, fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody
        war, have nobly established their general Liberty and Independence.
    </p>
    <p>
        This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of
        Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the
        strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us. To all general
        purposes we have uniformly been one people; each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same national
        rights, privileges, and protection. As a nation we have made peace and war: as a nation we have vanquished our
        common enemies: as a nation we have formed alliances and made treaties, and entered into various compacts and
        conventions with foreign States.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strong sense of the value and blessings of Union induced the people, at a very early period, to institute a
        Foederal Government to preserve and perpetuate it. They formed it almost as soon as they had a political
        existence; nay, at a time, when their habitations were in flames, when many of their Citizens were bleeding, and
        when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and
        reflections, which must ever precede the formation of a wise and well—balanced government for a free people. It
        is not to be wondered at, that a Government instituted in times so inauspicious, should on experiment be found
        greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        This intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects. Still continuing no less attached to Union, than
        enamored of Liberty, they observed the danger, which immediately threatened the former and more remotely the
        latter; and being persuaded that ample security for both, could only be found in a national Government more
        wisely framed, they, as with one voice, convened the late Convention at Philadelphia, to take that important
        subject under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Convention, composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people, and many of whom had become highly
        distinguished by their patriotism, virtue, and wisdom, in times which tried the minds and hearts of men,
        undertook the arduous task. In the mild season of peace, with minds unoccupied by other subjects, they passed
        many months in cool, uninterrupted, and daily consultations, and finally, without having been awed by power, or
        influenced by any passions except love for their Country, they presented and recommended to the people the plan
        produced by their joint and very unanimous councils.
    </p>
    <p>
        Admit, for so is the fact, that this plan is only recommended, not imposed, yet let it be remembered, that it is
        neither recommended to blind approbation, nor to blind reprobation; but to that sedate and candid consideration,
        which the magnitude and importance of the subject demand, and which it certainly ought to receive. But this, (as
        was remarked in the foregoing number of this Paper,) is more to be wished than expected, that it may be so
        considered and examined. Experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes. It is
        not yet forgotten, that well grounded apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of America to form the
        Memorable Congress of 1774. That Body recommended certain measures to their Constituents, and the event proved
        their wisdom; yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the Press began to teem with Pamphlets and weekly Papers
        against those very measures. Not only many of the Officers of Government, who obeyed the dictates of personal
        interest, but others, from a mistaken estimate of consequences, or the undue influence of former attachments, or
        whose ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good, were indefatigable in their
        endeavors to persuade the people to reject the advice of that Patriotic Congress. Many indeed were deceived and
        deluded, but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided judiciously; and happy they are in reflecting
        that they did so.
    </p>
    <p>
        They considered that the Congress was composed of many wise and experienced men. That being convened from
        different parts of the country they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of useful
        information. That in the course of the time they passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true
        interests of their country, they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head. That they were
        individually interested in the public liberty and prosperity, and therefore that it was not less their
        inclination that their duty, to recommend only such measures as after the most mature deliberation they really
        thought prudent and advisable.
    </p>
    <p>
        These and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the
        Congress; and they took their advice, notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter and dissuade
        them from it. But if the people at large had reason to confide in the men of that Congress, few of whom had then
        been fully tried or generally known, still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and advice of
        the Convention, for it is well known that some of the most distinguished members of that Congress, who have been
        since tried and justly approved for patriotism and abilities, and who have grown old in acquiring political
        information, were also members of this Convention, and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and
        experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is worthy of remark, that not only the first, but every succeeding Congress, as well as the late Convention,
        have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of America depended on its Union. To
        preserve and perpetuate it, was the great object of the people in forming that Convention, and it is also the
        great object of the plan which the Convention has advised them to adopt. With what propriety, therefore, or for
        what good purposes, are attempts at this particular period, made by some men, to depreciate the importance of
        the Union? Or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one? I am persuaded in
        my own mind, that the people have always thought right on this subject, and that their universal and uniform
        attachment to the cause of the Union rests on great and weighty reasons, which I shall endeavor to develop and
        explain in some ensuing papers. They who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct confederacies in
        the room of the plan of the Convention, seem clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the
        continuance of the Union in the utmost jeopardy: that certainly would be the case, and I sincerely wish that it
        may be as clearly foreseen by every good Citizen, that whenever the dissolution of the Union arrives, America
        will have reason to exclaim in the words of the Poet, “Farewell! A long Farewell, to all my Greatness.”
