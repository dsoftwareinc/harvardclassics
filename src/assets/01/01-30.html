        SCENE—Thebes, in front of the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter ANTIGONE and ISMENE
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIGONE ISMENE, mine own sister, dearest one;<br/>
        Is there, of all the ills of Œdipus,<br/>
        One left that Zeus will fail to bring on us,<br/>
        While still we live? for nothing is there sad<br/>
        Or full of woe, or base, or fraught with shame,<br/>
        But I have seen it in thy woes and mine.<br/>
        And now, what new decree is this they tell,<br/>
        Our ruler has enjoined on all the state?<br/>
        Know’st thou? hast heard? or is it hid from thee,<br/>
        The doom of foes that comes upon thy friends?
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. No tidings of our friends, Antigone,<br/>
        Painful or pleasant since that hour have come<br/>
        When we, two sisters, lost our brothers twain,<br/>
        In one day dying by each other’s hand.<br/>
        And since in this last night the Argive host<br/>
        Has left the field, I nothing further know,<br/>
        Nor brightening fortune, nor increasing gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. That knew I well, and therefore sent for thee<br/>
        Beyond the gates, that thou mayst hear alone.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. What meanest thou? It is but all to clear<br/>
        Thou broodest darkly o’er some tale of woe.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. And does not Creon treat our brothers twain<br/>
        One with the rites of burial, one with shame?<br/>
        Eteocles, so say they, he interred<br/>
        Fitly, with wonted rites, as one held meet<br/>
        To pass with honour to the gloom below.<br/>
        But for the corpse of Polynices, slain<br/>
        So piteously, they say, he has proclaimed<br/>
        To all the citizens, that none should give<br/>
        His body burial, or bewail his fate,<br/>
        But leave it still unsepulchred, unwept,<br/>
        A prize full rich for birds that scent afar<br/>
        Their sweet repast. So Creon bids, they say,<br/>
        Creon the good, commanding thee and me,<br/>
        Yes, me, I say, and now is coming here,<br/>
        To make it clear to those who knew it not,<br/>
        And counts the matter not a trivial thing;<br/>
        But whoso does the things that he forbids,<br/>
        For him, there waits within the city’s walls<br/>
        The death of stoning. Thus, then, stands thy case;<br/>
        And quickly thou wilt show, if thou art born<br/>
        Of noble nature, or degenerate liv’st,<br/>
        Base child of honoured parents.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. How could I,<br/>
        O daring in thy mood, in this our plight,<br/>
        Or doing or undoing, aught avail?
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. Wilt thou with me share risk and toil? Look to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. What risk is this? What purpose fills thy mind?
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. Wilt thou with me go forth to help the dead?
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. And dost thou mean to give him sepulture,<br/>
        When all have been forbidden?
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. He is still<br/>
        My brother; yes, and thine, though thou, it seems,<br/>
        Wouldst fain he were not. I desert him not.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. O daring one, when Creon bids thee not!
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. What right has he to keep me from mine own?
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. Ah me! remember, sister, how our sire<br/>
        Perished, with hate o’erwhelmed and infamy,<br/>
        From evils that he brought upon himself,<br/>
        And with his own hand robbed himself of sight,<br/>
        And how his wife and mother, both in one,<br/>
        With twist and cordage, cast away her life;<br/>
        And thirdly, how our brothers in one day<br/>
        In suicidal conflict wrought the doom,<br/>
        Each of the other. And we twain are left;<br/>
        And think, how much more wretchedly than all<br/>
        We twain shall perish, if, against the law,<br/>
        We brave our sovereign’s edict and his power.<br/>
        For this we need remember, we were born<br/>
        Women; as such, not made to strive with men.<br/>
        And next, that they who reign surpass in strength,<br/>
        And we must bow to this, and worse than this.<br/>
        I, then, entreating those that dwell below,<br/>
        To judge me leniently, as forced to yield,<br/>
        Will hearken to our rulers. Over-zeal<br/>
        In act or word but little wisdom shows.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. I would not ask thee. No! if thou shouldst wish<br/>
        To do it, and wouldst gladly join with me.<br/>
        Do what thou wilt, I go to bury him;<br/>
        And good it were, this having done, to die.<br/>
        Loved I shall be with him whom I have loved,<br/>
        Guilty of holiest crime. More time have I<br/>
        In which to win the favour of the dead,<br/>
        Than that of those who live; for I shall rest<br/>
        For ever there. But thou, if thus thou please,<br/>
        Count as dishonoured what the Gods approve.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. I do them no dishonour, but I find<br/>
        Myself too weak to war against the state.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. Make what excuse thou wilt, I go to rear<br/>
        A grave above the brother whom I love.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. Ah, wretched me! how much I fear for thee.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. Fear not for me. Thine own fate guide aright.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. At any rate, disclose this deed to none:<br/>
        Keep it close hidden. I will hide it too.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. Speak out! I bid thee. Silent, thou wilt be<br/>
        More hateful to me than if thou shouldst tell<br/>
        My deed to all men.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. Fiery is thy mood,<br/>
        Although thy deeds might chill the very blood.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. I know I please the souls I seek to please.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. If thou canst do it; but thy passion craves<br/>
        For things impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. I’ll cease to strive<br/>
        When strength shall fail me.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. Even from the first,<br/>
        It is not meet to seek what may not be.
    </p>
    <p>
        ANTIG. If thou speak thus, my hatred wilt thou gain,<br/>
        And rightly wilt be hated of the dead.<br/>
        Leave me and my ill counsel to endure<br/>
        This dreadful doom. I shall not suffer aught<br/>
        So evil as a death dishonourable.
    </p>
    <p>
        ISM. Go, then, if so thou wilt. Of this be sure,<br/>
        Wild as thou art, thy friends must love thee still. [Exeunt.]

    <p>
        Chor. Ray of the glorious sun,<br/>
        Brightest of all that ever shone on Thebes,<br/>
        Thebes with her seven high gates,<br/>
        Thou didst appear that day,<br/>
        Eye of the golden dawn,<br/>
        O’er Dirkè’s streams advancing,<br/>
        Driving with quickened curb,<br/>
        In haste of headlong flight,<br/>
        The warrior who, in panoply of proof,<br/>
        From Argos came, with shield as white as snow;<br/>
        Who came to this our land,<br/>
        Roused by the strife of tongues<br/>
        That Polynices stirred;<br/>
        Shrieking his shrill sharp cry,<br/>
        The eagle hovered round,<br/>
        With snow-white wing bedecked,<br/>
        Begirt with myriad arms,<br/>
        And flowing horsehair crests.

        ANTISTROPH. I

    <p>
        He stood above our towers,<br/>
        Circling, with blood-stained spears,<br/>
        The portals of our gates;<br/>
        He went, before he filled<br/>
        His jaws with blood of men,<br/>
        Before Hephæstus with his pitchy flame<br/>
        Had seized our crown of towers.<br/>
        So loud the battle din that Ares loves,<br/>
        Was raised around his rear,<br/>
        A conflict hard and stiff,<br/>
        E’en for his dragon foe.<br/>
        For breath of haughty speech<br/>
        Zeus hateth evermore exceedingly;<br/>
        And seeing them advance,<br/>
        Exulting in the clang of golden arms,<br/>
        With brandished fire he hurls them headlong down,<br/>
        In act, upon the topmost battlement<br/>
        Rushing, with eager step,<br/>
        To shout out, ‘Victory!’
    </p>
    <p>
        STROPH. II
    </p>
    <p>
        Crashing to earth he fell,<br/>
        Who came, with madman’s haste,<br/>
        Drunken, but not with wine,<br/>
        And swept o’er us with blasts,<br/>
        The whirlwind blasts of hate.<br/>
        Thus on one side they fare,<br/>
        And mighty Ares, bounding in his strength,<br/>
        Dashing now here, now there,<br/>
        Elsewhere brought other fate.<br/>
        For seven chief warriors at the seven gates met,<br/>
        Equals with equals matched,<br/>
        To Zeus, the Lord of War,<br/>
        Left tribute, arms of bronze;<br/>
        All but the hateful ones<br/>
        Who, from one father and one mother sprung,<br/>
        Stood wielding, hand to hand,<br/>
        Their doubly pointed spears;<br/>
        They had their doom of death,<br/>
        In common, shared by both.

        But now, since Victory, of mightiest name,<br/>
        Hath come to Thebes, of many chariots proud,<br/>
        Joying and giving joy,<br/>
        After these wars just past,<br/>
        Learn ye forgetfulness,<br/>
        And all night long, with dance and voice of hymns<br/>
        Let us go round to all the shrines of Gods,<br/>
        While Bacchus, making Thebes resound with shouts,<br/>
        Begins the strain of joy;<br/>
        But, lo! the sovereign of this land of ours,<br/>
        CREON, Menœkeus’ son,<br/>
        He, whom strange change and chances from the God<br/>
        Have nobly raised to power,<br/>
        Comes to us, steering on some new device;<br/>
        For, lo! he hath convened,<br/>
        By herald’s loud command,<br/>
        This council of the elders of our land.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter CREON
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. My Friends, for what concerns our commonwealth,<br/>
        The Gods who vexed it with the billowing storms<br/>
        Have righted it again; but I have sent,<br/>
        By special summons, calling you to come<br/>
        Apart from all the others, This, in part,<br/>
        As knowing ye did all along uphold<br/>
        The might of Laius’ throne, in part again,<br/>
        Because when Œdipus our country ruled,<br/>
        And, when he perished, then towards his sons<br/>
        Ye still were faithful in your steadfast mind.<br/>
        And since they fell, as by a double death,<br/>
        Both on the selfsame day with murderous blow,<br/>
        Smiting and being smitten, now I hold<br/>
        Their thrones and all their power of sov’reignty<br/>
        By nearness of my kindred to the dead.<br/>
        And hard it is to learn what each man is,<br/>
        In heart and mind and judgment, till one gains<br/>
        Experience in the exercise of power.<br/>
        For me, whoe’er is called to guide a state,<br/>
        And does not catch at counsels wise and good,<br/>
        But holds his peace through any fear of man,<br/>
        I deem him basest of all men that are,<br/>
        Of all that ever have been; and whoe’er<br/>
        As worthier than his country counts his friend,<br/>
        I utterly despise him. I myself,<br/>
        Zeus be my witness, who beholdeth all,<br/>
        Will not keep silence, seeing danger come,<br/>
        Instead of safety, to my subjects true.<br/>
        Nor could I take as friend my country’s foe;<br/>
        For this I know, that there our safety lies,<br/>
        And sailing in her while she holds her course,<br/>
        We gather friends around us. By these rules<br/>
        And such as these will I maintain the state.<br/>
        And now I come, with edicts close allied<br/>
        To these in spirit, for my subjects all,<br/>
        Concerning those two sons of Œdipus.<br/>
        Eteocles, who died in deeds of might<br/>
        Illustrious, fighting for our fatherland,<br/>
        To honour him with sepulture, all rites<br/>
        Duly performed that to the noblest dead<br/>
        Of right belong. Not so his brother; him<br/>
        I speak of, Polynices, who, returned<br/>
        From exile, sought with fire and sword to waste<br/>
        His father’s city and the shrines of Gods,<br/>
        Yea, sought to glut his rage with blood of men,<br/>
        And lead them captives to the bondslave’s doom;<br/>
        Him I decree that none should dare entomb,<br/>
        That none should utter wail or loud lament,<br/>
        But leave his corpse unburied, by the dogs<br/>
        And vultures mangled, foul to look upon.<br/>
        Such is my purpose. Ne’er, if I can help,<br/>
        Shall the vile share the honours of the just;<br/>
        But whoso shows himself my country’s friend,<br/>
        Living or dead, from me shall honour gain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chor. This is thy pleasure, O Menœkeus’ son,<br/>
        For him who hated, him who loved our state;<br/>
        And thou hast power to make what laws thou wilt,<br/>
        Both for the dead and all of us who live.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Be ye, then, guardians of the things I speak.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chor. Commit this task to one of younger years.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. The watchmen are appointed for the corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chor. What duty, then, enjoin’st thou on another?
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Not to consent with those that disobey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chor. None are so foolish as to seek for death.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. And that shall be his doom; but love of gain<br/>
        Hath oft with false hopes lured men to their death.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter Guard
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. I will not say, O king, that I am come<br/>
        Panting with speed and plying nimble feet,<br/>
        For I had many halting-points of thought,<br/>
        Backwards and forwards turning, round and round;<br/>
        For now my mind would give me sage advice:<br/>
        “Poor wretch, and wilt thou go and bear the blame?”<br/>
        Or—“Dost thou tarry now? Shall Creon know<br/>
        These things from others? How wilt thou escape?”<br/>
        Resolving thus, I came in haste, yet slow,<br/>
        And thus a short way finds itself prolonged,<br/>
        But, last of all, to come to thee prevailed.<br/>
        And though I tell of naught, thou shalt hear all;<br/>
        For this one hope I cling to steadfastly,<br/>
        That I shall suffer nothing but my fate.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. What is it, then, that causes such dismay?
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. First, for mine own share in it, this I say,<br/>
        I did not do it, do not know who did,<br/>
        Nor should I rightly come to ill for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Thou tak’st good aim and fencest up thy tale<br/>
        All round and round. ’Twould seem thou hast some news.
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. Yea, news of fear engenders long delay.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Tell thou thy tale, and then depart in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. And speak I will. The corpse … Some one has been<br/>
        But now and buried it, a little dust<br/>
        O’er the skin scattering, with the wonted rites.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. What say’st thou? Who has dared this deed of guilt?
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. I know not. Neither was there stroke of spade,<br/>
        Nor earth cast up by mattock. All the soil<br/>
        Was dry and hard, no track of chariot wheel;<br/>
        But he who did it went and left no sign.<br/>
        But when the first day’s watchman showed it us,<br/>
        The sight caused wonder and sore grief to all,<br/>
        For he had disappeared. No tomb, indeed,<br/>
        Was over him, but dust all lightly strown,<br/>
        As by some hand that shunned defiling guilt;<br/>
        And no work was there of a beast of prey<br/>
        Or dog devouring. Evil words arose<br/>
        Among us, guard to guard imputing blame,<br/>
        Which might have come to blows, for none was there<br/>
        To check its course, and each to each appeared<br/>
        The man whose hand had done it. As for proof,<br/>
        That there was none, and so he ’scaped our ken.<br/>
        And we were ready in our hands to take<br/>
        Bars of hot iron, and to walk through fire,<br/>
        And call the Gods to witness none of us<br/>
        Had done the deed, nor knew who counselled it,<br/>
        Nor who had wrought it. Then at last, when naught<br/>
        Was gained by all our searching, some one says<br/>
        What made us bend our gaze upon the ground<br/>
        In fear and trembling; for we neither saw<br/>
        How to oppose it, nor, accepting it,<br/>
        How we might prosper in it. And his speech<br/>
        Was this, that all our tale should go to thee,<br/>
        Not hushed up anywise. This gained the day;<br/>
        And me, ill-starred, the lot condemns to win<br/>
        This precious prize. So here I come to thee<br/>
        Against my will; and surely do I trow<br/>
        Thou dost not wish to see me. Still ’tis true<br/>
        That no man loves the messenger of ill.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chor. For me, my prince, my mind some time has thought<br/>
        That this perchance has some divine intent.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Cease thou, before thou fillest me with wrath,<br/>
        Lest thou be found a dastard and a fool.<br/>
        For what thou say’st is most intolerable,<br/>
        That for this corpse the providence of Gods<br/>
        Has any care. What! have they buried him,<br/>
        As to their patron paying honours high,<br/>
        Who came to waste their columned shrines with fire,<br/>
        To desecrate their offerings and their lands,<br/>
        And all their wonted customs? Dost thou see<br/>
        The Gods approving men of evil deeds?<br/>
        It is not so; but men of rebel mood,<br/>
        Lifting their head in secret long ago,<br/>
        Have stirred this thing against me. Never yet<br/>
        Had they their neck beneath the yoke, content<br/>
        To own me as their ruler. They, I know,<br/>
        Have bribed these men to let the deed be done.<br/>
        No thing in use by man, for power of ill,<br/>
        Can equal money. This lays cities low,<br/>
        This drives men forth from quiet dwelling-place,<br/>
        This warps and changes minds of worthiest stamp,<br/>
        To turn to deeds of baseness, teaching men<br/>
        All shifts of cunning, and to know the guilt<br/>
        Of every impious deed. But they who, hired,<br/>
        Have wrought this crime, have laboured to their cost,<br/>
        Or soon or late to pay the penalty.<br/>
        But if Zeus still claims any awe from me,<br/>
        Know this, and with an oath I tell it thee,<br/>
        Unless ye find the very man whose hand<br/>
        Has wrought this burial, and before mine eyes<br/>
        Present him captive, death shall not suffice,<br/>
        Till first, impaled still living, ye shall show<br/>
        The story of this outrage, that henceforth,<br/>
        Knowing what gain is lawful, ye may grasp<br/>
        At that, and learn it is not meet to love<br/>
        Gain from all quarters. By base profit won,<br/>
        You will see more destroyed than prospering.
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. May I, then speak? Or shall I turn and go?
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Dost thou not see how vexing are thy words?
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. Is it thine ears they trouble, or thy soul?
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Why dost thou gauge my trouble where it is?
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. The doer grieves thy heart, but I thine ears.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Pshaw! what a babbler, born to prate, art thou.
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. And therefore not the man to do this deed.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Yes, that too; selling e’en thy soul for pay.
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. Ah me!<br/>
        How fearful ’tis, in thinking, false to think.
    </p>
    <p>
        CREON. Prate about thinking; but unless ye show<br/>
        To me the doers, ye shall say ere long<br/>
        That evil gains still work their punishment. [Exit.]
    </p>
    <p>
        GUARD. God send we find him! Should we find him not,<br/>
        As well may be, for this must chance decide,<br/>
        You will not see me coming here again;<br/>
        For now, being safe beyond all hope of mine,<br/>
        Beyond all thought, I owe the Gods much thanks. [Exit]
