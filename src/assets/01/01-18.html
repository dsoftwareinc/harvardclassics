        XANTHIAS. SHALL I crack any of those old jokes, master, <br/>
        At which the audience never fail to laugh?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIONYSUS. Aye, what you will, except I’m getting crushed: <br/>
        Fight shy of that: I’m sick of that already.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Nothing else smart?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Aye, save my shoulder’s aching.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Come now, that comical joke?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. With all my heart. <br/>
        Only be careful not to shift your pole. <br/>
        And— XAN. What? DIO. And vow that you’ve a belly-ache.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. May I not say I’m overburdened so <br/>
        That if none ease me, I must ease myself?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. For mercy’s sake, not till I’m going to vomit.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. What! must I bear these burdens, and not make <br/>
        One of the jokes Ameipsias and Lycis <br/>
        And Phrynichus, in every play they write, <br/>
        Put in the mouths of all their burden-bearers?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Don’t make them; no! I tell you when I see <br/>
        Their plays, and hear those jokes, I come away <br/>
        More than a twelvemonth older than I went.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. O, thrice unlucky neck of mine, which now <br/>
        Is getting crushed, yet must not crack its joke!
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Now is not this fine pampered insolence <br/>
        When I myself, Dionysus, son of—Pipkin, <br/>
        Toil on afoot, and let this fellow ride, <br/>
        Taking no trouble, and no burden bearing?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. What, don’t I bear? DIO. How can you when you’re riding?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Why, I bear these. DIO. How? XAN. Most unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Does not the donkey bear the load you’re bearing?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Not what I bear myself: by Zeus, not he.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. How can you bear, when you are borne yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Don’t know: but anyhow my shoulder’s aching.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Then since you say the donkey helps you not, <br/>
        You lift him up and carry him in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. O, hang it all! why didn’t I fight at sea? <br/>
        You should have smarted bitterly for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Get down, you rascal; I’ve been trudging on <br/>
        Till now I’ve reached the portal, where I’m going <br/>
        First to turn in. Boy! Boy! I say there, Boy!
    </p>
    <p>
        HERACLES. Who banged the door? How like a prancing Centaur <br/>
        He drove against it! Mercy o’ me, what’s this?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Boy. XAN. Yes. DIO. Did you observe? XAN. What? DIO. How alarmed <br/>
        He is. XAN. Aye, truly, lest you’ve lost your wits.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. O, by Demeter, I can’t choose but laugh. <br/>
        Biting my lips won’t stop me. Ha! ha! ha!
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Pray you, come hither, I have need of you.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. I vow I can’t help laughing, I can’t help it. <br/>
        A lion’s hide upon a yellow silk, <br/>
        A club and buskin! What’s it all about? <br/>
        Where were you going? DIO. I was serving lately <br/>
        Aboard the—Cleisthenes. HER. And fought? DIO. And sank <br/>
        More than a dozen of the enemy’s ships.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. You two? DIO. We two. HER. And then I awoke, and lo!
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. There as, on deck, I’m reading to myself <br/>
        The “Andromeda,” a sudden pang of longing <br/>
        Shoots through my heart, you can’t conceive how keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. How big a pang? DIO. A small one, Molon’s size.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Caused by a woman? DIO. No. HER. A boy? DIO. No, no.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. A man? DIO. Ah! ah! HER. Was it for Cleisthenes?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Don’t mock me, brother; on my life I am <br/>
        In a bad way: such fierce desire consumes me.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Aye, little brother? how? DIO. I can’t describe it. <br/>
        But yet I’ll tell you in a riddling way. <br/>
        Have you e’er felt a sudden lust for soup?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Soup! Zeus-a-mercy, yes, ten thousand times.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Is the thing clear, or must I speak again?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Not of the soup: I’m clear about the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Well, just that sort of pang devours my heart <br/>
        For lost Euripides. HER. A dead man too.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. And no one shall persuade me not to go <br/>
        After the man. HER. Do you mean below, to Hades?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. And lower still, if there’s a lower still.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. What on earth for? DIO. I want a genuine poet, <br/>
        “For some are not, and those that are, are bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. What! does not Iophon live? DIO. Well, he’s the sole <br/>
        Good thing remaining, if even he is good. <br/>
        For even of that I’m not exactly certain.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. If go you must, there’s Sophocles—he comes <br/>
        Before Euripides—why not take him?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Not till I’ve tried if Iophon’s coin rings true <br/>
        When he’s alone, apart from Sophocles. <br/>
        Besides, Euripides, the crafty rogue, <br/>
        Will find a thousand shifts to get away, <br/>
        But he was easy here, is easy there.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. But Agathon, where is he? DIO. He has gone and left us. <br/>
        A genial poet, by his friends much missed.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Gone where? DIO. To join the blessed in their banquets.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. But what of Xenocles? DIO. O, he be hanged!
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Pythangelus? XAN. But never a word of me, <br/>
        Not though my shoulder’s chafed so terribly.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. But have you not a shoal of little songsters, <br/>
        Tragedians by the myriad, who can chatter <br/>
        A furlong faster than Euripides?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Those be mere vintage-leavings, jabberers, choirs <br/>
        Of swallow-broods, degraders of their art, <br/>
        Who get one chorus, and are seen no more, <br/>
        The Muses’ love once gained. But, O my friend, <br/>
        Search where you will, you’ll never find a true <br/>
        Creative genius, uttering startling things.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Creative? how do you mean? DIO. I mean a man <br/>
        Who’ll dare some novel venturesome conceit, <br/>
        Air, Zeus’ chamber, or Time’s foot, or this: <br/>
        ’Twas not my mind that swore: my tongue committed <br/>
        A little perjury on its own account.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. You like that style? DIO. Like it? I dote upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. I vow it’s ribald nonsense, and you know it.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. “Rule not my mind”: you’ve got a house to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Really and truly, though, ’tis paltry stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Teach me to dine! XAN. But never a word of me.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. But tell me truly—’twas for this I came <br/>
        Dressed up to mimic you—what friends received <br/>
        And entertained you when you went below <br/>
        To bring back Cerberus, in case I need them.<br/>
        And tell me too the havens, fountains, shops,<br/>
        Roads, resting-places, stews, refreshment rooms,<br/>
        Towns, lodgings, hostesses, with whom were found <br/>
        The fewest bugs. XAN. But never a word of me.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. You are really game to go?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, drop that, can’t you? <br/>
        And tell me this: of all the roads you know, <br/>
        Which is the quickest way to get to Hades? <br/>
        I want one not too warm, nor yet too cold.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Which shall I tell you first? which shall it be? <br/>
        There’s one by rope and bench: you launch away <br/>
        And—hang yourself. DIO. No, thank you: that’s too stifling.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Then there’s a track, a short and beaten cut, <br/>
        By pestle and mortar. DIO. Hemlock, do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Just so. DIO. No, that’s too deathly cold a way; <br/>
        You have hardly started ere your shins get numbed.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Well, would you like a steep and swift descent?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Aye, that’s the style: my walking powers are small.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Go down to the Cerameicus. DIO. And do what?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Climb to the tower’s top pinnacle— DIO. And then?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Observe the torch-race started, and when all <br/>
        The multitude is shouting Let them go, <br/>
        Let yourself go. DIO. Go whither? HER. To the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, that would break my brain’s two envelopes. <br/>
        I’ll not try that. HER. Which will you try? DIO. The way <br/>
        You went yourself. HER. A parlous voyage that, <br/>
        For first you’ll come to an enormous lake <br/>
        Of fathomless depth. DIO. And how and I to cross?
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. An ancient mariner will row you over <br/>
        In a wee boat, so big. The fare’s two obols.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Fie! The power two obols have, the whole world through! <br/>
        How came they thither? HER. Theseus took them down. <br/>
        And next you’ll see great snakes and savage monsters <br/>
        In tens of thousands. DIO. You needn’t try to scare me, <br/>
        I’m going to go. HER. Then weltering seas of filth <br/>
        And ever-rippling dung: and plunged therein, <br/>
        Whoso has wronged the stranger here on earth, <br/>
        Or robbed his boylove of the promised pay, <br/>
        Or swinged his mother, or profanely smitten <br/>
        His father’s cheek, or sworn an oath forsworn, <br/>
        Or copied out a speech of Morsimus.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. There too, perdie, should he be plunged, whoe’er <br/>
        Has danced the sword-dance of Cinesias.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. And next the breath of flutes will float around you, <br/>
        And glorious sunshine, such as ours, you’ll see,<br/>
        And myrtle groves, and happy bands who clap <br/>
        Their hands in triumph, men and women too.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. And who are they? HER. The happy mystic bands,
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. And I’m the donkey in the mystery show. <br/>
        But I’ll not stand it, not one instant longer.
    </p>
    <p>
        HER. Who’ll tell you everything you want to know. <br/>
        You’ll find them dwelling close beside the road <br/>
        You are going to travel, just at Pluto’s gate. <br/>
        And fare thee well, my brother. DIO. And to you <br/>
        Good cheer. (To Xan.) Now, sirrah, pick you up the traps.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Before I’ve put them down? DIO. And quickly too.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. No, prithee, no; but hire a body, one <br/>
        They’re carrying out, on purpose for the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. If I can’t find one? XAN. Then I’ll take them. DIO. Good. <br/>
        And see! they are carrying out a body now. <br/>
        Hallo! you there, you deadman, are you willing <br/>
        To carry down our little traps to Hades?
    </p>
    <p>
        CORPSE. What are they? DIO. These. CORP. Two drachmas for the job?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Nay, that’s too much. CORP. Out of the pathway, you!
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Beshrew thee, stop: maybe we’ll strike a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
        CORP. Pay me two drachmas, or it’s no use talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. One and a half. CORP. I’d liefer live again!
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. How absolute the knave is! He be hanged! <br/>
        I’ll go myself. DIO. You’re the right sort, my man. <br/>
        Now to the ferry. CHARON. Yoh, up! lay her to.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Whatever’s that? DIO. Why, that’s the lake, by Zeus, <br/>
        Whereof he spake, and yon’s the ferry-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Poseidon, yes, and that old fellow’s Charon.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Charon! O welcome, Charon! welcome, Charon!
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Who’s for the Rest from every pain and ill? <br/>
        Who’s for the Lethe’s plain? the Donkey-shearings? <br/>
        Who’s for Cerberia? Taenarum? or the Ravens?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. I. CHAR. Hurry in. DIO. But where are you going really? <br/>
        In truth to the Ravens? CHAR. Aye, for your behoof. <br/>
        Step in. DIO. (To Xan.) Now, lad. CHAR. A slave? I take no slave, <br/>
        Unless he has fought for his bodyrights at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. I couldn’t go. I’d got the eye-disease.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Then fetch a circuit round about the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Where must I wait? CHAR. Beside the Withering stone, <br/>
        Hard by the Rest. DIO. You understand? XAN. Too well. <br/>
        O, what ill omen crossed me as I started!
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. (To Dio.) Sit to the oar. (Calling.) Who else for the boat? Be quick. <br/>
        (To Dio.) Hi! What are you doing? DIO. What am I doing? Sitting <br/>
        On to the oar. You told me to, yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Now sit you there, you little Potgut. DIO. So?
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Now stretch your arms full length before you. DIO. So?
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Come, don’t keep fooling; plant your feet, and now <br/>
        Pull with a will. DIO. Why, how am I to pull? <br/>
        I’m not an oarsman, seaman, Salaminian. <br/>
        I can’t! CHAR. You can. Just dip your oar in once, <br/>
        You’ll hear the loveliest timing songs. DIO. What from?
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Frog-swans, most wonderful. DIO. Then give the word.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Heave ahoy! heave ahoy!
    </p>
    <p>
        FROGS. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax! <br/>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax! <br/>
        We children of the fountain and the lake, <br/>
        Let us wake <br/>
        Our full choir-shout, as the flutes are ringing out, <br/>
        Our symphony of clear-voiced song. <br/>
        The song we used to love, in the Marshland up above, <br/>
        In praise of Dionysus to produce, <br/>
        Of Nysaean Dionysus, son of Zeus, <br/>
        When the revel-tipsy throng, all crapulous and gay, <br/>
        To our precinct reeled along on the holy <br/>
        Pitcher day. <br/>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, dear! O, dear! now I declare <br/>
        I’ve got a bump upon my rump.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. But you, perchance, don’t care.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Hang you, and your ko-axing too! <br/>
        There’s nothing but ko-ax with you.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. That is right, Mr. Busybody, right! <br/>
        For the Muses of the lyre love us well; <br/>
        And hornfoot Pan who plays on the pipe his jocund lays; <br/>
        And Apollo, Harper bright, in our Chorus takes delight; <br/>
        For the strong reed’s sake which I grow within my lake <br/>
        To be girdled in his lyre’s deep shell. <br/>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. My hands are blistered very sore; <br/>
        My stern below is sweltering so, <br/>
        ’Twill soon, I know, upturn and roar <br/>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax. <br/>
        O tuneful race, O, pray give o’er, <br/>
        O, sing no more. FR. Ah, no! ah, no! <br/>
        Loud and louder our chant must flow. <br/>
        Sing if ever ye sang of yore, <br/>
        When in sunny and glorious days <br/>
        Through the rushes and marsh-flags springing <br/>
        On we swept, in the joy of singing <br/>
        Myriad-diving roundelays. <br/>
        Or when fleeing the storm, we went <br/>
        Down to the depths, and our choral song <br/>
        Wildly raised to a loud and long <br/>
        Bubble-bursting accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. This timing song I take from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. That’s a dreadful thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Much more dreadful, if I row <br/>
        Till I burst myself, I trow.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Go, hang yourselves; for what care I?
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. All the same we’ll shout and cry, <br/>
        Stretching all our throats with song, <br/>
        Shouting, crying, all day long,
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. and DIO. Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. In this you’ll never, never win.
    </p>
    <p>
        FR. This you shall not beat us in.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. No, nor ye prevail o’er me. <br/>
        Never! never! I’ll my song <br/>
        Shout, if need be, all day long, <br/>
        Until I’ve learned to master your ko-ax. <br/>
        Brekekekex, ko-ax, ko-ax. <br/>
        I thought I’d put a stop to your ko-ax.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHAR. Stop! Easy! Take the oar and push her to. <br/>
        Now pay your fare and go. DIO. Here ’tis: two obols. <br/>
        Xanthias! where’s Xanthias? Is it Xanthias there?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Hoi, hoi! DIO. Come hither. XAN. Glad to meet you, master.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. What have you there? XAN. Nothing but filth and darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. But tell me, did you see the parricides <br/>
        And perjured folk he mentioned? XAN. Didn’t you?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Poseidon, yes. Why, look! (Pointing to the audience.) I see them now. <br/>
        What’s the next step? XAN. We’d best be moving on. <br/>
        This is the spot where Heracles declared <br/>
        Those savage monsters dwell. DIO. O, hang the fellow! <br/>
        That’s all his bluff: he thought to scare me off, <br/>
        The jealous dog, knowing my plucky ways. <br/>
        There’s no such swaggerer lives as Heracles. <br/>
        Why, I’d like nothing better than to achieve <br/>
        Some bold adventure, worthy of our trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. I know you would. Hallo! I hear a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Where? what? XAN. Behind us, there. DIO. Get you behind.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. No, it’s in front. DIO. Get you in front directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. And now I see the most ferocious monster.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, what’s it like? XAN. Like everything by turns. <br/>
        Now it’s a bull: now it’s a mule: and now <br/>
        The loveliest girl. DIO. O, where? I’ll go and meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. It’s ceased to be a girl: it’s a dog now.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. It is Empusa! XAN. Well, its face is all <br/>
        Ablaze with fire. DIO. Has it a copper leg?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. A copper leg? yes, one; and one of cow dung.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, whither shall I flee? XAN. O, whither I?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. My priest, protect me, and we’ll sup together.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. King Heracles, we’re done for. DIO. O, forbear,
        Good fellow, call me anything but that.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Well, then, Dionysus. DIO. O, that’s worse again.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. (To the Spectre.) Aye, go thy way. O master, here, come here.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. O, what’s up now? XAN. Take courage; all’s serene. <br/>
        And, like Hegelochus, we now may say, <br/>
        “Out of the storm there comes a new fine wether.” <br/>
        Empusa’s gone. DIO. Swear it. XAN. By Zeus she is.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Swear it again. XAN. By Zeus. DIO. Again. XAN. By Zeus. <br/>
        O, dear, O, dear, how pale I grew to see her, <br/>
        But he from fright has yellowed me all over.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Ah me, whence fall these evils on my head? <br/>
        Who is the god to blame for my destruction? <br/>
        Air, Zeus’ chamber, or the Foot of Time?
    </p>
    <p>
        (A flute is played behind the scenes.)
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Hist! XAN. What’s the matter? DIO. Didn’t you hear it?
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. What?
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. The breath of flutes. XAN. Aye, and a whiff of torches <br/>
        Breathed o’er me too; a very mystic whiff.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Then crouch we down, and mark what’s going on.
    </p>
    <p>
        CHORUS. (In the distance.) O Iacchus! <br/>
        O Iacchus! O Iacchus!
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. O have it, master: ’tis those blessed Mystics, <br/>
        Of whom he told us, sporting hereabouts. <br/>
        They sing the Iacchus which Diagoras made.
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. I think so too: we had better both keep quiet <br/>
        And so find out exactly what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        (The calling forth of Iacchus.)
    </p>
    <p>
        CHOR. O Iacchus! power excelling, here in stately temples dwelling, <br/>
        O Iacchus! O Iacchus! <br/>
        Come to tread this verdant level, <br/>
        Come to dance in mystic revel, <br/>
        Come whilst round thy forehead hurtles <br/>
        Many a wreath of fruitful myrtles, <br/>
        Come with wild and saucy paces <br/>
        Mingling in our joyous dance, <br/>
        Pure and holy, which embraces all the charms of all the Graces, <br/>
        When the mystic choirs advance.
    </p>
    <p>
        XAN. Holy and sacred queen, Demeter’s daughter, <br/>
        O, what a jolly whiff of pork breathed o’er me!
    </p>
    <p>
        DIO. Hist! and perchance you’ll get some tripe yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        (The welcome to Iacchus.)
    </p>
    <p>
        CHOR. Come, arise, from sleep awaking, come the fiery torches shaking, <br/>
        O Iacchus! O Iacchus! <br/>
        Morning Star that shinest nightly. <br/>
        Lo, the mead is blazing brightly, <br/>
        Age forgets its years and sadness, <br/>
        Agèd knees curvet for gladness, <br/>
        Lift thy flashing torches o’er us, <br/>
        Marshal all thy blameless train, <br/>
        Lead, O, lead the way before us; lead the lovely youthful Chorus <br/>
        To the marshy flowery plain.
