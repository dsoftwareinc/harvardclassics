        ST. AGNES’ EVE!—Ah, bitter chill it was! <br/>
        The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;<br/>
        The hare limp’d trembling through the frozen grass,<br/>
        And silent was the flock in woolly fold:<br/>
        Numb were the Beadsman’s fingers, while he told<br/>
        His rosary, and while his frosted breath,<br/>
        Like pious incense from a censer old,<br/>
        Seem’d taking flight for heaven, without a death,<br/>
        Past the sweet Virgin’s picture, while his prayer he saith.
    </p>
    <p>
        His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;<br/>
        Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,<br/>
        And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,<br/>
        Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees:<br/>
        The sculptur’d dead, on each side, seem to freeze,<br/>
        Emprison’d in black, purgatorial rails:<br/>
        Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat’ries,<br/>
        He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails<br/>
        To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.
    </p>
    <p>
        Northward he turneth through a little door,<br/>
        And scarce three steps, ere Music’s golden tongue<br/>
        Flatter’d to tears this aged man and poor;<br/>
        But no—already had his deathbell rung;<br/>
        The joys of all his life were said and sung:<br/>
        His was harsh penance on St. Agnes’ Eve:<br/>
        Another way he went, and soon among<br/>
        Rough ashes sat he for his soul’s reprieve,<br/>
        And all night kept awake, for sinners’ sake to grieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft;<br/>
        And so it chanc’d, for many a door was wide,<br/>
        From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft,<br/>
        The silver, snarling trumpets ’gan to chide:<br/>
        The level chambers, ready with their pride,<br/>
        Were glowing to receive a thousand guests:<br/>
        The carved angels, ever eager-eyed,<br/>
        Star’d where upon their heads the cornice rests,<br/>
        With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
        At length burst in the argent revelry,<br/>
        With plume, tiara, and all rich array,<br/>
        Numerous as shadows haunting fairily<br/>
        The brain, new stuff’d, in youth, with triumphs gay<br/>
        Of old romance. These let us wish away,<br/>
        And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there,<br/>
        Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,<br/>
        On love, and wing’d St. Agnes’ saintly care,<br/>
        As she had heard old dames full many times declare.
    </p>
    <p>
        They told her how, upon St. Agnes’ Eve,<br/>
        Young virgins might have visions of delight,<br/>
        And soft adorings from their loves receive<br/>
        Upon the honey’d middle of the night<br/>
        If ceremonies due they did aright;<br/>
        As, supperless to bed they must retire,<br/>
        And couch supine their beauties, lily white;<br/>
        Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require<br/>
        Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline;<br/>
        The music, yearning like a God in pain,<br/>
        She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,<br/>
        Fix’d on the floor, saw many a sweeping train<br/>
        Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain<br/>
        Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,<br/>
        And back retir’d; not cool’d by high disdain,<br/>
        But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere:<br/>
        She sigh’d for Agnes’ dreams, the sweetest of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        She danc’d along with vague, regardless eyes,<br/>
        Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short:<br/>
        The hallow’d hour was near at hand: she sighs<br/>
        Amid the timbrels, and the throng’d resort<br/>
        Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;<br/>
        ’Mid looks of love, defiance, hate and scorn,<br/>
        Hoodwink’d with faery fancy; all amort,<br/>
        Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn,<br/>
        And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, purposing each moment to retire,<br/>
        She linger’d still. Meantime, across the moors,<br/>
        Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire<br/>
        For Madeline. Beside the portal doors,<br/>
        Buttress’d from moonlight, stands he, and implores<br/>
        All saints to give him sight of Madeline,<br/>
        But for one moment in the tedious hours,<br/>
        That he might gaze and worship all unseen;<br/>
        Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been.
    </p>
    <p>
        He ventures in: let no buzz’d whisper tell:<br/>
        All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords<br/>
        Will storm his heart, Love’s fev’rous citadel;<br/>
        For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,<br/>
        Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords,<br/>
        Whose very dogs would execrations howl<br/>
        Against his lineage: not one breast affords<br/>
        Him any mercy, in that mansion foul,<br/>
        Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came,<br/>
        Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,<br/>
        To where he stood, hid from the torch’s flame,<br/>
        Behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond<br/>
        The sound of merriment and chorus bland:<br/>
        He startled her; but soon she knew his face,<br/>
        And grasp’d his fingers in her palsied hand,<br/>
        Saying, ‘Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place;<br/>
        They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Get hence! get hence! there’s dwarfish Hildebrand;<br/>
        He had a fever late and in the fit<br/>
        He cursed thee and thine, both house and land:<br/>
        Then there’s that old Lord Maurice, not a whit<br/>
        More tame for his grey hairs—Alas me! flit!<br/>
        Flit like a ghost away.’—’Ah, Gossip dear,<br/>
        We’re safe enough; here in this armchair sit,<br/>
        And tell me how’—‘Good Saints! not here, not here;<br/>
        Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.’
    </p>
    <p>
        He follow’d through a lowly arched way,<br/>
        Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume;<br/>
        And as she mutter’d ‘Well-a—well-a-day!<br/>
        He found him in a little moonlight room,<br/>
        Pale, lattic’d, chill, and silent as a tomb.<br/>
        ‘Now tell me where is Madeline,’ said he,<br/>
        ‘O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom<br/>
        Which none but secret sisterhood may see,<br/>
        When they St. Agnes’ wool are weaving piously.’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes’ Eve—<br/>
        Yet men will murder upon holy days:<br/>
        Thou must hold water in a witch’s sieve,<br/>
        And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays,<br/>
        To venture so: it fills me with amaze<br/>
        To see thee, Porphyro!—St. Agnes’ Eve!<br/>
        God’s help! my lady fair the conjurer plays<br/>
        This very night: good angels her deceive!<br/>
        But let me laugh awhile, I’ve mickle time to grieve.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,<br/>
        While Porphyro upon her face doth look,<br/>
        Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone<br/>
        Who keepeth clos’d a wond’rous riddle-book,<br/>
        As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.<br/>
        But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told<br/>
        His lady’s purpose; and he scarce could brook<br/>
        Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold,<br/>
        And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,<br/>
        Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart<br/>
        Made purple riot: then doth he propose<br/>
        A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:<br/>
        ‘A cruel man, and impious thou art:<br/>
        Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream<br/>
        Alone with her good angels, far apart<br/>
        From wicked men like thee. Go, go!—I deem<br/>
        Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,’<br/>
        Quoth Porphyro: ‘O may I ne’er find grace<br/>
        When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,<br/>
        If one of her soft ringlets I displace,<br/>
        Or look with ruffian passion in her face:<br/>
        Good Angela, believe me by these tears;<br/>
        Or I will, even in a moment’s space,<br/>
        Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen’s ears,<br/>
        And beard them, though they be more fang’d than wolves and bears.’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?<br/>
        A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,<br/>
        Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;<br/>
        Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,<br/>
        Were never miss’d.’ Thus plaining, doth she bring<br/>
        A gentler speech from burning Porphyro;<br/>
        So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,<br/>
        That Angela gives promise she will do<br/>
        Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy.<br/>
        Even to Madeline’s chamber, and there hide<br/>
        Him in a closet, of such privacy<br/>
        That he might see her beauty unespied,<br/>
        And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,<br/>
        While legion’d faeries pac’d the coverlet,<br/>
        And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.<br/>
        Never on such a night have lovers met,<br/>
        Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘It shall be as thou wishest,’ said the Dame:<br/>
        ‘All cates and dainties shall be stored there<br/>
        Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame<br/>
        Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,<br/>
        For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare<br/>
        On such a catering trust my dizzy head.<br/>
        Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer<br/>
        The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,<br/>
        Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.’
    </p>
    <p>
        So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.<br/>
        The lover’s endless minutes slowly pass’d;<br/>
        The Dame return’d, and whisper’d in his ear<br/>
        To follow her; with agèd eyes aghast<br/>
        From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,<br/>
        Through many a dusky gallery, they gain<br/>
        The maiden’s chamber, silken, hush’d, and chaste;<br/>
        Where Porphyro took covert, pleas’d amain.<br/>
        His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her falt’ring hand upon the balustrade,<br/>
        Old Angela was feeling for the stair,<br/>
        When Madeline, St. Agnes’ charmèd maid,<br/>
        Rose, like a mission’d spirit, unaware:<br/>
        With silver taper’s light, and pious care,<br/>
        She turn’d, and down the agèd gossip led<br/>
        To a safe level matting. Now prepare,<br/>
        Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed;<br/>
        She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray’d and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Out went the taper as she hurried in;<br/>
        Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died;<br/>
        She clos’d the door, she panted, all akin<br/>
        To spirits of the air, and visions wide:<br/>
        No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!<br/>
        But to her heart, her heart was voluble,<br/>
        Paining with eloquence her balmy side;<br/>
        As though a tongueless nightingale should swell<br/>
        Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.
    </p>
    <p>
        A casement high and triple-arch’d there was,<br/>
        All garlanded with carven imag’ries<br/>
        Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,<br/>
        And diamonded with panes of quaint device,<br/>
        Unnumerable of stains and splendid dyes.<br/>
        As are the tiger-moth’s deep-damask’d wings;<br/>
        And in the midst, ’mong thousand heraldries,<br/>
        And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,<br/>
        A shielded scutcheon blush’d with blood of queens and kings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,<br/>
        And threw warm gules on Madeline’s fair breast,<br/>
        As down she knelt for heaven’s grace and boon;<br/>
        Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,<br/>
        And on her silver cross soft amethyst,<br/>
        And on her hair a glory, like a saint:<br/>
        She seem’d a splendid angel, newly drest,<br/>
        Save wings, for heaven: Porphyro grew faint:<br/>
        She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,<br/>
        Of all its wreathèd pearls her hair she frees;<br/>
        Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one;<br/>
        Loosens her fragrant bodice; by degrees<br/>
        Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees;<br/>
        Half-hidden, like a mermaid in seaweed,<br/>
        Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees<br/>
        In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed,<br/>
        But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,<br/>
        In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex’d she lay,<br/>
        Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress’d<br/>
        Her soothèd limbs, and soul fatigued away;<br/>
        Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;<br/>
        Blissfully haven’d both from joy and pain;<br/>
        Clasp’d like a missal where swart Paynims pray;<br/>
        Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,<br/>
        As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stol’n to this paradise, and so entranced,<br/>
        Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress,<br/>
        And listen’d to her breathing, if it chanced<br/>
        To wake into a slumberous tenderness;<br/>
        Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,<br/>
        And breath’d himself: then from the closet crept,<br/>
        Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,<br/>
        And over the hush’d carpet, silent, stepped,<br/>
        And ’tween the curtains peep’d, where, lo!—how fast she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon<br/>
        Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set<br/>
        A table, and, half-anguish’d, threw thereon<br/>
        A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:—<br/>
        O for some drowsy Morphean amulet!<br/>
        The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,<br/>
        The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarionet,<br/>
        Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:—<br/>
        The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
        And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,<br/>
        In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender’d,<br/>
        While he from forth the closet brought a heap<br/>
        Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd:<br/>
        With jellies soother than the creamy curd,<br/>
        And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon:<br/>
        Manna and dates, in argosy transferr’d<br/>
        From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one,<br/>
        From silken Samarcand to cedar’d Lebanon.
    </p>
    <p>
        These delicates he heap’d with glowing hand<br/>
        On golden dishes and in baskets bright<br/>
        Of wreathèd silver: sumptuous they stand<br/>
        In the retired quiet of the night,<br/>
        Filling the chilly room with perfume light.—<br/>
        ‘And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!<br/>
        Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:<br/>
        Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes’ sake,<br/>
        Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm<br/>
        Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream<br/>
        By the dusk curtains:—’twas a midnight charm<br/>
        Impossible to melt as icèd stream:<br/>
        The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam:<br/>
        Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:<br/>
        It seem’d he never, never could redeem<br/>
        From such a steadfast spell his lady’s eyes;<br/>
        She mus’d awhile, entoil’d in woofed phantasies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,—<br/>
        Tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be,<br/>
        He play’d an ancient ditty, long since mute,<br/>
        In Provence call’d, ‘La belle dame sans merci:’<br/>
        Close to her ear touching the melody;—<br/>
        Wherewith disturb’d, she utter’d a soft moan:<br/>
        He ceased—she panted quick—and suddenly<br/>
        Her blue affrighted eyes wide open shone:<br/>
        Upon his knees he sank, as smooth-sculptured stone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,<br/>
        Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:<br/>
        There was a painful change, that nigh expell’d<br/>
        The blisses of her dream so pure and deep<br/>
        At which fair Madeline began to weep,<br/>
        And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;<br/>
        While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;<br/>
        Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye,<br/>
        Fearing to move or speak, she look’d so dreamingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Ah, Porphyro!’ said she, ‘but even now<br/>
        Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,<br/>
        Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;<br/>
        And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear:<br/>
        How chang’d thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!<br/>
        Give me that voice again, my Porphyro,<br/>
        Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!<br/>
        Oh leave me not in this eternal woe,<br/>
        For if thou diest, my Love, I know not where to go.’
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond a mortal man impassion’d far<br/>
        At these voluptuous accents, he arose,<br/>
        Ethereal, flush’d, and like a throbbing star<br/>
        Seen mid the sapphire heaven’s deep repose;<br/>
        Into her dream he melted, as the rose<br/>
        Blendeth its odour with the violet,—<br/>
        Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows<br/>
        Like Love’s alarum pattering the sharp sleet<br/>
        Against the window-panes; St. Agnes’ moon hath set.
    </p>
    <p>
        ’Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:<br/>
        ‘This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!’<br/>
        ’Tis dark: the icèd gusts still rave and beat:<br/>
        ‘No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!<br/>
        Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.—<br/>
        Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?<br/>
        I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,<br/>
        Though thou forsakest a deceived thing:—<br/>
        A dove forlorn and lost with sick unprunèd wing!’
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!<br/>
        Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?<br/>
        Thy beauty’s shield, heart-shap’d and vermeil dyed?<br/>
        Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest<br/>
        After so many hours of toil and quest,<br/>
        A famish’d pilgrim,—saved by miracle.<br/>
        Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest<br/>
        Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think’st well<br/>
        To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Hark! ’tis an elfin-storm from faery land,<br/>
        Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:<br/>
        Arise—arise! the morning is at hand;—<br/>
        The bloated wassailers will never heed:—<br/>
        Let us away, my love, with happy speed;<br/>
        There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,—<br/>
        Drown’d all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead:<br/>
        Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be,<br/>
        For o’er the southern moors I have a home for thee.’
    </p>
    <p>
        She hurried at his words, beset with fears,<br/>
        For there were sleeping dragons all around,<br/>
        At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears—<br/>
        Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.—<br/>
        In all the house was heard no human sound.<br/>
        A chain-droop’d lamp was flickering by each door;<br/>
        The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,<br/>
        Flutter’d in the besieging wind’s uproar<br/>
        And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;<br/>
        Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;<br/>
        Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl,<br/>
        With a huge empty flagon by his side:<br/>
        The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,<br/>
        But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:<br/>
        By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:—<br/>
        The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;—<br/>
        The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.
    </p>
    <p>
        And they are gone: aye, ages long ago<br/>
        These lovers fled away into the storm.<br/>
        That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe,<br/>
        And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form<br/>
        Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,<br/>
        Were long be-nightmar’d. Angela the old<br/>
        Died palsy-twitch’d, with meagre face deform;<br/>
        The Beadsman, after thousand aves told,<br/>
        For aye unsought-for slept among his ashes cold.
