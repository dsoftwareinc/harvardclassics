    <h2>Canto XXX</h2>
    <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Beatrice descends from Heaven, and rebukes the Poet.
    </p>
    <p>
        SOON as that polar light, fair ornament <br/>
        Of the first Heaven, which hath never known<br/>
        Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil<br/>
        Of other cloud than sin, to duty there<br/>
        Each one convoying, as that lower doth<br/>
        The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix’d;<br/>
        Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van<br/>
        Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,<br/>
        Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:<br/>
        And one, as if commission’d from above,<br/>
        In holy chant thrice shouted forth aloud;<br/>
        “Come, spouse! from Libanus:” and all the rest<br/>
        Took up the song.—At the last audit, so<br/>
        The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each<br/>
        Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh;<br/>
        As, on the sacred litter, at the voice<br/>
        Authoritative of that elder, sprang<br/>
        A hundred ministers and messengers<br/>
        Of life eternal. “Blessed thou, who comest!”<br/>
        And, “Oh!” they cried, “from full hands scatter ye<br/>
        Unwithering lilies”: and, so saying, cast<br/>
        Flowers overhead and round them on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,<br/>
        The eastern clime all roseate; and the sky<br/>
        Opposed, one deep and beautiful serene;<br/>
        And the sun’s face so shaded, and with mists<br/>
        Attemper’d, at his rising, that the eye<br/>
        Long while endured the sight: thus, in a cloud<br/>
        Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,<br/>
        And down within and outside of the car<br/>
        Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreathed,<br/>
        A virgin in my view appear’d, beneath<br/>
        Green mantle, robed in hue of living flame:<br/>
        And o’er my spirit, that so long a time<br/>
        Had from her presence felt no shuddering dread,<br/>
        Albeit mine eyes discern’d her not, there moved<br/>
        A hidden virtue from her, at whose touch<br/>
        The power of ancient love was strong within me.
    </p>
    <p>
        No sooner on my vision streaming, smote<br/>
        The heavenly influence, which, years past, and e’en<br/>
        In childhood, thrill’d me, than towards Virgil I<br/>
        Turn’d me to leftward; panting, like a babe,<br/>
        That flees for refuge to his mother’s breast,<br/>
        If aught have terrified or work’d him woe:<br/>
        And would have cried, “There is no dram of blood,<br/>
        That doth not quiver in me. The old flame<br/>
        Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire.”<br/>
        But Virgil had bereaved us of himself;<br/>
        Virgil, my best-loved father, Virgil, he<br/>
        To whom I gave me up for safety: nor<br/>
        All, our prime mother lost, avail’d to save<br/>
        My undew’d cheeks from blur of soiling tears.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Dante! weep not that Virgil leaves thee; nay,<br/>
        Weep thou not yet: behoves thee feel the edge<br/>
        Of other sword; and thou shalt weep for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
        As to the prow or stern, some admiral<br/>
        Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,<br/>
        When ’mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;<br/>
        Thus, on the left side of the car, I saw<br/>
        (Turning me at the sound of mine own name,<br/>
        Which here I am compell’d to register)<br/>
        The virgin station’d, who before appear’d<br/>
        Veil’d in that festive shower angelical.
    </p>
    <p>
        Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;<br/>
        Though from her brow the veil descending, bound<br/>
        With foliage of Minerva, suffer’d not<br/>
        That I beheld her clearly: then with act<br/>
        Full royal, still insulting o’er her thrall,<br/>
        Added, as one who, speaking, keepeth back<br/>
        The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:<br/>
        “Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am<br/>
        Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign’d at last<br/>
        Approach the mountain? Knewest not, O man!<br/>
        Thy happiness is here?” Down fell mine eyes<br/>
        On the clear fount; but there, myself espying,<br/>
        Recoil’d, and sought the greensward; such a weight<br/>
        Of shame was on my forehead. With a mien<br/>
        Of that stern majesty, which doth surround<br/>
        A mother’s presence to her awe-struck child,<br/>
        She look’d; a flavor of such bitterness<br/>
        Was mingled in her pity. There her words<br/>
        Brake off; and suddenly the angels sang,<br/>
        “In thee, O gracious Lord! my hope hath been”:<br/>
        But went no further than, “Thou, Lord! hast set<br/>
        My feet in ample room” As snow, that lies,<br/>
        Amidst the living rafters on the back<br/>
        Of Italy, congeal’d, when drifted high<br/>
        And closely piled by rough Sclavonian blasts;<br/>
        Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,<br/>
        And straightway melting it distills away,<br/>
        Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,<br/>
        Without a sigh or tear, or ever these<br/>
        Did sing, that, with the chiming of Heaven’s sphere,<br/>
        Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain<br/>
        Of dulcet symphony express’d for me<br/>
        Their soft compassion, more than could the words,<br/>
        “Virgin! why so consumest him?” then, the ice<br/>
        Congeal’d about my bosom, turn’d itself<br/>
        To spirit and water; and with anguish forth<br/>
        Gush’d, through the lips and eyelids, from the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon the chariot’s same edge still she stood,<br/>
        Immovable; and thus address’d her words<br/>
        To those bright semblances with pity touch’d:<br/>
        “Ye in the eternal day your vigils keep;<br/>
        So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,<br/>
        Conveys from you a single step, in all<br/>
        The goings on of time: thence, with more heed<br/>
        I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,<br/>
        Who there stands weeping; that the sorrow now<br/>
        May equal the transgression. Not alone<br/>
        Through operation of the mighty orbs,<br/>
        That mark each seed to some predestined aim,<br/>
        As with aspect or fortunate or ill<br/>
        The constellations meet; but through benign<br/>
        Largess of heavenly graces, which rain down<br/>
        From such a height as mocks our vision, this man<br/>
        Was, in the freshness of his being, such,<br/>
        So gifted virtually, that in him<br/>
        All better habits wondrously had thrived<br/>
        The more of kindly strength is in the soil,<br/>
        So much doth evil seed and lack of culture<br/>
        Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.<br/>
        These looks sometime upheld him; for I show’d<br/>
        My youthful eyes, and led him by their light<br/>
        In upright walking. Soon as I had reach’d<br/>
        Tee threshold of my second age, and changed<br/>
        My mortal for immortal; then he left me,<br/>
        And gave himself to others. When from flesh<br/>
        To spirit I had risen, and increase<br/>
        Of beauty and of virtue circled me,<br/>
        I was less dear to him, and valued less.<br/>
        His steps were turn’d into deceitful ways,<br/>
        Following false images of good, that make<br/>
        No promise perfect. Nor avail’d me aught<br/>
        To sue for inspirations, with the which,<br/>
        I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,<br/>
        Did call him back; of them, so little reck’d him.<br/>
        Such depth he fell, that all device was short<br/>
        Of his preserving, save that he should view<br/>
        The children of perdition. To this end<br/>
        I visited the purlieus of the dead:<br/>
        And one, who hath conducted him thus high,<br/>
        Received my supplications urged with weeping.<br/>
        It were a breaking of God’s high decree,<br/>
        If Lethe should be pass’d, and such food tasted,<br/>
        Without the cost of some repentant tear.”
    </p>
    <h2>Canto XXXI</h2>
    <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Beatrice continues her reprehension of Dante, who confesses his error, and falls to the ground; coming
        to himself again, he is by Matilda drawn through the waters of Lethe, and presented first to the four virgins
        who figure the cardinal virtues; these in their turn lead him to the Gryphon, a symbol of our Saviour; and the
        three virgins, representing the evangelical virtues, intercede for him with Beatrice, that she would display to
        him her second beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
        “O THOU!” her words she thus without delay<br/>
        Resuming, turn’d their point on me, to whom<br/>
        They, with but lateral edge, seem’d harsh before:<br/>
        “Say thou, who stand’st beyond the holy stream,<br/>
        If this be true. A charge, so grievous, needs<br/>
        Thine own avowal.” On my faculty<br/>
        Such strange amazement hung, the voice expired<br/>
        Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little space refraining, then she spake:<br/>
        “What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave<br/>
        On thy remembrances of evil yet<br/>
        Hath done no injury.” A mingled sense<br/>
        Of fear and of confusion, from my lips<br/>
        Did such a “Yea” produce, as needed help<br/>
        Of vision to interpret. As when breaks,<br/>
        In act to be discharged, a cross-bow bent<br/>
        Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o’erstretch’d;<br/>
        The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark:<br/>
        Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst,<br/>
        Beneath the heavy load: and thus my voice<br/>
        Was slacken’d on its way. She straight began:<br/>
        “When my desire invited thee to love<br/>
        The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings;<br/>
        What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain<br/>
        Did meet thee, that thou so shouldst quit the hope<br/>
        Of further progress? or what bait of ease,<br/>
        Or promise of allurement, led thee on<br/>
        Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere shouldst rather wait?”
    </p>
    <p>
        A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice<br/>
        To answer; hardly to these sounds my lips<br/>
        Gave utterance, wailing: “Thy fair looks withdrawn,<br/>
        Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn’d<br/>
        My steps aside.” She answering spake: “Hadst thou<br/>
        Been silent, or denied what thou avow’st,<br/>
        Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more; such eye<br/>
        Observes it. But whene’er the sinner’s cheek<br/>
        Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears<br/>
        Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel<br/>
        Of justice doth run counter to the edge.<br/>
        Howe’er, that thou mayst profit by thy shame<br/>
        For errors past, and that henceforth more strength<br/>
        May arm thee, when thou hear’st the Syren-voice;<br/>
        Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,<br/>
        And lend attentive ear, while I unfold<br/>
        How opposite a way my buried flesh<br/>
        Should have impell’d thee. Never didst thou spy,<br/>
        In art or nature, aught so passing sweet,<br/>
        As were the limbs that in their beauteous frame<br/>
        Enclosed me, and are scatter’d now in dust.<br/>
        If sweetest thing thus fail’d thee with my death,<br/>
        What, afterward, of moral, should thy wish<br/>
        Have tempted? When thou first hadst felt the dart<br/>
        Of perishable things, in my departing<br/>
        For better realms, thy wing thou shouldst have pruned<br/>
        To follow me; and never stoop’d again,<br/>
        To ’bide a second blow, for a slight girl,<br/>
        Or other gaud as transient and as vain.<br/>
        The new and inexperienced bird awaits,<br/>
        Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler’s aim;<br/>
        But in the sight of one whose plumes are full,<br/>
        In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing’d.”
    </p>
    <p>
        I stood, as children silent and ashamed<br/>
        Stand, listening, with their eyes upon the earth,<br/>
        Acknowledging their fault, and self-condemn’d.<br/>
        And she resumed: “If, but to hear, thus pains thee,<br/>
        Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do.”
    </p>
    <p>
        With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,<br/>
        Rent from its fibres by a blast, that blows<br/>
        From off the pole, or from Iarbas’ land,<br/>
        Than I at her behest my visage raised:<br/>
        And thus the face denoting by the beard,<br/>
        I mark’d the secret sting her words convey’d.
    </p>
    <p>
        No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,<br/>
        Than I perceived those primal creatures cease<br/>
        Their flowery sprinkling; and mine eyes beheld<br/>
        (Yet unassured and wavering in their view)<br/>
        Beatrice; she, who toward the mystic shape,<br/>
        That joins two natures in one form, had turn’d:<br/>
        And, even under shadow of her veil,<br/>
        And parted by the verdant rill that flow’d<br/>
        Between, in loveliness she seem’d as much<br/>
        Her former self surpassing, as on earth<br/>
        All others she surpass’d. Remorseful goads<br/>
        Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more<br/>
        Its love had late beguiled me, now the more<br/>
        Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote<br/>
        The bitter consciousness, that on the ground<br/>
        O’erpower’d I fell: and what my state was then,<br/>
        She knows, who was the cause. When now my strength<br/>
        Flow’d back, returning outward from the heart,<br/>
        The lady, whom alone I first had seen,<br/>
        I found above me. “Loose me not,” she cried:<br/>
        “Loose not thy hold:” and lo! had dragg’d me high<br/>
        As to my neck into the stream; while she,<br/>
        Still as she drew me after, swept along,<br/>
        Swift as a shuttle, bounding o’er the wave.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blessed shore approaching, then was heard<br/>
        So sweetly, “Tu asperges me,” that I<br/>
        May not remember, much less tell the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp’d<br/>
        My temples, and immerged me where ’twas fit<br/>
        The wave should drench me: and, thence raising up,<br/>
        Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs<br/>
        Presented me so laved; and with their arm<br/>
        They each did cover me. “Here are we nymphs,
    </p>
    <p>
        And in the heaven are stars. Or ever earth<br/>
        Was visited of Beatrice, we,<br/>
        Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.<br/>
        We to her eyes will lead thee: but the light<br/>
        Of gladness, that is in them, well to scan,<br/>
        Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,<br/>
        Thy sight shall quicken.” Thus began their song:<br/>
        And then they led me to the Gryphon’s breast,<br/>
        Where, turn’d toward us, Beatrice stood.<br/>
        “Spare not thy vision. We have station’d thee<br/>
        Before the emeralds, whence love, erewhile,<br/>
        Hath drawn his weapons on thee.” As they spake,<br/>
        A thousand fervent wishes riveted<br/>
        Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood,<br/>
        Still fix’d toward the Gryphon, motionless.<br/>
        As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus<br/>
        Within those orbs the twofold being shone;<br/>
        Forever varying, in one figure now<br/>
        Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse<br/>
        How wondrous in my sight it seem’d, to mark<br/>
        A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,<br/>
        Yet in its imaged semblance mutable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul<br/>
        Fed on the viand, whereof still desire<br/>
        Grows with satiety; the other three,<br/>
        With gesture that declared a loftier line,<br/>
        Advanced: to their own carol, on they came<br/>
        Dancing, in festive ring angelical.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Turn, Beatrice!” was their song: “Oh! turn<br/>
        Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,<br/>
        Who, to behold thee, many a wearisome pace<br/>
        Hath measured. Gracious at our prayer, vouchsafe<br/>
        Unveiled to him thy cheeks; that he may mark<br/>
        Thy second beauty, now conceal’d.” O splendour!<br/>
        O sacred light eternal! who is he,<br/>
        So pale with musing in Pierian shades,<br/>
        Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,<br/>
        Whose spirit should not fail him in the essay<br/>
        To represent thee such as thou didst seem,<br/>
        When under cope of the still-chiming Heaven<br/>
        Thou gavest to open air thy charms reveal’d?
    </p>
    <h2>Canto XXXII</h2>
    <p>
        ARGUMENT.—Dante is warned not to gaze too fixedly on Beatrice. The procession moves on, accompanied by Matilda,
        Statius, and Dante, till they reach an exceeding lofty tree, where divers strange chances befall.
    </p>
    <p>
        MINE eyes with such an eager coveting<br/>
        Were bent to rid them of their ten years’ thirst,<br/>
        Not other sense was waking: and e’en they<br/>
        Were fenced on either side from heed of aught;<br/>
        So tangled, in its custom’d toils, that smile<br/>
        Of saintly brightness drew me to itself:<br/>
        When forcibly, toward the left, my sight<br/>
        The sacred virgins turn’d; for from their lips<br/>
        I heard the warning sounds: “Too fix’d a gaze!”
    </p>
    <p>
        A while my vision labour’d; as when late<br/>
        Upon the o’erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:<br/>
        But soon, to lesser object, as the view<br/>
        Was now recover’d, (lesser in respect<br/>
        To that excess of sensible, whence late<br/>
        I had perforce been sunder’d), on their right<br/>
        I mark’d that glorious army wheel, and turn,<br/>
        Against the sun and sevenfold lights, their front.<br/>
        As when, their bucklers for protection raised,<br/>
        A well-ranged troop, with portly banners curl’d,<br/>
        Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground;<br/>
        E’en thus the goodly regiment of Heaven<br/>
        Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car<br/>
        Had sloped his beam. Attendant at the wheels<br/>
        The damsels turn’d; and on the Gryphon moved<br/>
        The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,<br/>
        No feather on him trembled. The fair dame,<br/>
        Who through the wave had drawn me, companied<br/>
        By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,<br/>
        Whose orbit, rolling, mark’d a lesser arch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the high wood, now void, (the more her blame,<br/>
        Who by the serpent was beguiled), I pass’d,<br/>
        With step in cadence to the harmony<br/>
        Angelic. Onward had we moved, as far,<br/>
        Perchance, as arrow at three several flights<br/>
        Full wing’d had sped, when from her station down<br/>
        Descended Beatrice. With one voice<br/>
        All murmur’d “Adam”; circling next a plant<br/>
        Despoil’d of flowers and leaf, on every bough,<br/>
        Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,<br/>
        Were such, as ’midst their forest wilds, for height,<br/>
        The Indians might have gazed at. “Blessed thou,<br/>
        Gryphon! whose beak hath never pluck’d that tree<br/>
        Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite<br/>
        Was warp’d to evil.” Round the stately trunk<br/>
        Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return’d<br/>
        The animal twice-gender’d: “Yea! for so<br/>
        The generation of the just are saved.”<br/>
        And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot<br/>
        He drew it of the widow’d branch, and bound<br/>
        There, left unto the stock whereon it grew.
    </p>

        As when large floods of radiance from above<br/>
        Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends<br/>
        Next after setting of the scaly sign,<br/>
        Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew<br/>
        His wonted colours, ere the sun have yoked<br/>
        Beneath another star his flamy steeds;<br/>
        Thus putting forth a hue more faint than rose,<br/>
        And deeper than the violet, was renew’d<br/>
        The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.<br/>
        Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.<br/>
        I understood it not, nor to the end<br/>
        Endured the harmony. Had I the skill<br/>
        To pencil forth how closed the unpitying eyes<br/>
        Slumbering, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid<br/>
        So dearly for their watching), then, like painter,<br/>
        That with a model paints, I might design<br/>
        The manner of my falling into sleep.<br/>
        But feign who will the slumber cunningly,<br/>
        I pass it by to when I waked; and tell,<br/>
        How suddenly a flash of splendour rent<br/>
        The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out,<br/>
        “Arise; what dost thou?” As the chosen three,<br/>
        On Tabor’s mount, admitted to behold<br/>
        The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit<br/>
        Is coveted of Angels, and doth make<br/>
        Perpetual feast in Heaven; to themselves<br/>
        Returning, at the word whence deeper sleeps<br/>
        Were broken, they their tribe diminish’d saw;<br/>
        Both Moses and Elias gone, and changed<br/>
        The stole their Master wore; thus to myself<br/>
        Returning, over me beheld I stand<br/>
        The piteous one, who, cross the stream, had brought<br/>
        My steps. “And where,” all doubting, I exclaim’d,<br/>
        “Is Beatrice?”—“See her,” she replied,<br/>
        “Beneath the fresh leaf, seated on its root.<br/>
        Behold the associate choir that circles her.<br/>
        The others, with a melody more sweet<br/>
        And more profound, journeying to higher realms,<br/>
        Upon the Gryphon tend.” If there her words<br/>
        Were closed, I know not; but mine eyes had now<br/>
        Ta’en view of her, by whom all other thoughts<br/>
        Were barr’d admittance. On the very ground<br/>
        Alone she sat, as she had there been left<br/>
        A guard upon the wain, which I beheld<br/>
        Bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs<br/>
        Did make themselves a cloister round about her;<br/>
        And, in their hands, upheld those lights secure<br/>
        From blast septentrion and the gusty south.
    </p>
    <p>
        “A little while thou shalt be forester here;<br/>
        And citizen shalt be, forever with me,<br/>
        Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman,<br/>
        To profit the misguided world, keep now<br/>
        Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,<br/>
        Take heed thou write, returning to that place.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclined<br/>
        Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes<br/>
        I, as she bade, directed. Never fire,<br/>
        With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud<br/>
        Leap’d downward from the welkin’s farthest bound,<br/>
        As I beheld the bird of Jove, descend<br/>
        Down through the tree; and, as he rush’d, the rind<br/>
        Disparting crush beneath him; buds much more,<br/>
        And leaflets. On the car, with all his might<br/>
        He struck; whence, staggering, like a ship it reel’d,<br/>
        At random driven, to starboard now, o’ercome,<br/>
        And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, springing up into the chariot’s womb,<br/>
        A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pined<br/>
        Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins<br/>
        The saintly maid rebuking him, away<br/>
        Scampering he turn’d, fast as his hide-bound corpse<br/>
        Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came,<br/>
        I saw the eagle dart into the hull<br/>
        O’ the car, and leave it with his feathers lined:<br/>
        And then a voice, like that which issues forth<br/>
        From heart with sorrow rived, did issue forth<br/>
        From Heaven, and “O poor bark of mine!” it cried,<br/>
        “How badly art thou freighted.” Then it seem’d<br/>
        That the earth open’d, between either wheel;<br/>
        And I beheld a dragon issue thence,<br/>
        That through the chariot fix’d his forked train;<br/>
        And like a wasp, that draggeth back the sting,<br/>
        So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg’d<br/>
        Part of the bottom forth; and went his way,<br/>
        Exulting. What remain’d, as lively turf<br/>
        With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,<br/>
        Which haply had, with purpose chaste and kind,<br/>
        Been offer’d; and therewith were clothed the wheels,<br/>
        Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly,<br/>
        A sigh were not breathed sooner. Thus transform’d,<br/>
        The holy structure, through its several parts,<br/>
        Did put forth heads; three on the beam, and one<br/>
        On every side: the first like oxen horn’d;<br/>
        But with a single horn upon their front,<br/>
        The four. Like monster, sight hath never seen.<br/>
        O’er it methought there sat, secure as rock<br/>
        On mountain’s lofty top, a shameless whore,<br/>
        Whose ken roved loosely round her. At her side,<br/>
        As ’t were that none might bear her off, I saw<br/>
        A giant stand; and ever and anon<br/>
        They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes<br/>
        Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion<br/>
        Scourged her from head to foot all o’er; then full<br/>
        Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloosed<br/>
        The monster, and dragg’d on, so far across<br/>
        The forest, that from me its shades alone<br/>
        Shielded the harlot and the new-form’d brute.
