        PRAISE be to God, the Beneficent King, the Creator of the universe, who hath raised the heavens without pillars,
        and spread out the earth as a bed; and blessing and peace be on the lord of apostles, our lord and our master
        Mohammad, and his Family; blessing and peace, enduring and constant, unto the day of judgment.

        To proceed:—The lives of former generations are a lesson to posterity; that a man may review the remarkable
        events which have happened to others, and be admonished; and may consider the history of people of preceding
        ages, and of all that hath befallen them, and be restrained. Extolled be the perfection of Him who hath thus
        ordained the history of former generations to be a lesson to those which follow. Such are the Tales of a
        Thousand and One Nights, with their romantic stories and their fables.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is related (but God alone is all-knowing, as well as all-wise, and almighty, and all-bountiful), that there
        was, in ancient times, a King of the countries of India and China, possessing numerous troops, and guards, and
        servants, and domestic dependents; and he had two sons; one of whom was a man of mature age; and the other, a
        youth. Both of these princes were brave horsemen; but especially the elder, who inherited the kingdom of his
        father, and governed his subjects with such justice that the inhabitants of his country and whole empire loved
        him. He was called King Shahriyar: his younger brother was named Shah-Zeman, and was King of Samarkand. The
        administration of their governments was conducted with rectitude, each of them ruling over his subjects with
        justice during a period of twenty years with the utmost enjoyment and happiness. After this period, the elder
        King felt a strong desire to see his brother, and ordered his Wezir to repair to him and bring him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having taken the advice of the Wezir on this subject, he immediately gave orders to prepare handsome presents,
        such as horses adorned with gold and costly jewels, and memluks, and beautiful virgins, and expensive stuffs. He
        then wrote a letter to his brother, expressive of his great desire to see him; and having sealed it, and given
        it to the Wezir, together with the presents above mentioned, he ordered the minister to strain his nerves, and
        tuck up his skirts, and use all expedition in returning. The Wezir answered, without delay, I hear and obey; and
        forthwith prepared for the journey: he packed his baggage, removed the burdens, and made ready all his
        provisions within three days; and on the fourth day, he took leave of the King Shahriyar, and went forth towards
        the deserts and wastes. He proceeded night and day; and each of the kings under the authority of King Shahriyar
        by whose residence he passed came forth to meet him, with costly presents, and gifts of gold and silver, and
        entertained him three days; after which, on the fourth day, he accompanied him one day’s journey, and took leave
        of him. Thus he continued on his way until he drew near to the city of Samarkand, when he sent forward a
        messenger to inform King Shah-Zeman of his approach. The messenger entered the city, inquired the way to the
        palace, and, introducing himself to the King, kissed the ground before him, and acquainted him with the approach
        of his brother’s Wezir; upon which Shah-Zeman ordered the chief officers of his court, and the great men of his
        kingdom, to go forth a day’s journey to meet him; and they did so; and when they met him, they welcomed him, and
        walked by his stirrups until they returned to the city. The Wezir then presented himself before the King
        Shah-Zeman, greeted him with a prayer for he divine assistance in his favour, kissed the ground before him, and
        informed him of his brother’s desire to see him; after which he handed to him the letter. The King took it, read
        it, and understood its contents; and answered by expressing his readiness to obey the commands of his brother.
        But, said he (addressing the Wezir), I will not go until I have entertained thee three days. Accordingly, he
        lodged him in a palace befitting his rank, accommodated his troops in tents, and appointed them all things
        requisite in the way of food and drink: and so they remained three days. On the fourth day, he equipped himself
        for the journey, made ready his baggage, and collected together costly presents suitable to his brother’s
        dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
        These preparations being completed, he sent forth his tents and camels and mules and servants and guards,
        appointed his Wezir to be governor of the country during his absence, and set out towards his brother’s
        dominions. At midnight, however, he remembered that he had left in his palace an article which he should have
        brought with him; and having returned to the palace to fetch it, he there beheld his wife sleeping in his bed,
        and attended by a male negro slave, who had fallen asleep by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
        On beholding this scene, the world became black before his eyes; and he said within himself, If this is the case
        when I have not departed from the city, what will be the conduct of this vile woman while I am sojourning with
        my brother? He then drew this sword, and slew them both in the bed: after which he immediately returned, gave
        orders for departure, and journeyed to his brother’s capital.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shahriyar, rejoicing at the tidings of his approach, went forth to meet him, saluted him, and welcomed him with
        the utmost delight. He then ordered that the city should be decorated on the occasion, and sat down to entertain
        his brother with cheerful conversation: but the mind of King Shah-Zeman was distracted by reflections upon the
        conduct of his wife; excessive grief took possession of him; and his countenance became sallow; and his frame
        emaciated. His brother observed his altered condition, and, imagining that it was occasioned by his absence from
        his dominions, abstained from troubling him or asking respecting the cause, until after the lapse of some days,
        when at length he said to him, O my brother, I perceive that thy body is emaciated, and thy countenance is
        become sallow. He answered, O brother, I have an internal sore:—and he informed him not of the conduct of his
        wife which he had witnessed. Shahriyar then said, I wish that thou wouldest go out with me on a hunting
        excursion; perhaps thy mind might so be diverted:—but he declined; and Shahriyar went alone to the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now there were some windows in the King’s palace commanding a view of his garden; and while his brother was
        looking out from one of these, a door of the palace was opened, and there came forth from it twenty females and
        twenty male black slaves; and the King’s wife, who was distinguished by extraordinary beauty and elegance,
        accompanied them to a fountain, where they all disrobed themselves, and sat down together. The King’s wife then
        called out, O Mes’ud! and immediately a black slave came to her, and embraced her; she doing the like. So also
        did the other slaves and the women; and all of them continued revelling together until the close of the day.
        When Shah-Zeman beheld this spectacle he said within himself, By Allah! my affliction is lighter than this! His
        vexation and grief were alleviated, and he no longer abstained from sufficient food and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
        When his brother returned from his excursion, and they had saluted each other, and King Shahriyar observed his
        brother Shah-Zeman, that his colour had returned, that his face had recovered the flush of health and that he
        ate with appetite, after his late abstinence, he was surprised, and said, O my brother, when I saw thee last,
        thy countenance was sallow, and now thy colour hath returned to thee: acquaint me with thy state.—As to the
        change of my natural complexion, answered Shah-Zeman, I will inform thee of its cause; but excuse my explaining
        to thee the return of my colour.—First, said Shahriyar, relate to me the cause of the change of thy proper
        complexion, and of thy weakness: let me hear it.—Know then, O my brother, he answered, that when thou sentest
        thy Wezir to me to invite me to thy presence, I prepared myself for the journey, and when I had gone forth from
        the city, I remembered that I had left behind me the jewel that I had gone forth from the city, I remembered
        that I had left behind me the jewel that I have given thee; I therefore returned to my palace for it, and there
        I found my wife sleeping in my bed, and attended by a black male slave; and I killed them both, and came to
        thee: but my mind was occupied by reflections upon this affair, and this was the cause of the change of my
        complexion, and of my weakness: now, as to the return of my colour, excuse my informing thee of its cause.—But
        when his brother heard these words, he said, I conjure thee by Allah that thou acquaint me with the cause of the
        return of thy colour:—so he repeated to him all that he had seen. I would see this, said Shahriyar, with my own
        eye.—Then, said Shah-Zeman, give out that thou art going again to the chase, and conceal thyself here with me,
        and thou shalt witness this conduct, and obtain ocular proof of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shahriyar, upon this, immediately announced that it was his intention to make another excursion. The troops went
        out of the city with the tents, and the King followed them; and after he had reposed awhile in the camp, he said
        to his servants, Let no one come in to me:—and he disguised himself, and returned to his brother in the palace,
        and sat in one of the windows overlooking the garden; and when he had been there a short time, the women and
        their mistress entered the garden with the black slaves, and did as his brother had described, continuing so
        until the hour of the afternoon-prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
        When King Shahriyar beheld this occurrence, reason fled from his head, and he said to his brother, Shah-Zeman,
        Arise, and let us travel whither we please, and renounce the regal state, until we see whether such a calamity
        as this have befallen any other person like unto us; and if not, our death will be preferable to our life. His
        brother agreed to his proposal, and they went out from a private door of the palace, and journeyed continually,
        days and nights, until they arrived at a tree in the midst of a meadow, by a spring of water, on the shore of
        the sea. They drank of this spring, and sat down to rest; and when the day had a little advanced, the sea became
        troubled before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending towards the sky, and approaching the
        meadow. Struck with fear at the sight, they climbed up into the tree, which was lofty; and thence they gazed to
        see what this might be: and behold, it was a Jinni of gigantic stature, broad-fronted and bulky, bearing on his
        head a chest. He landed, and came to the tree into which the two kings had climbed, and, having seated himself
        beneath it, opened the chest, and took out of it another box, which he also opened; and there came forth from it
        a young woman, fair and beautiful, like the shining sun. When the Jinni cast his eyes upon her, he said, O lady
        of noble race, whom I carried off on thy wedding-night, I have a desire to sleep a little: and he placed his
        head upon her knee, and slept. The damsel then raised her head towards the tree, and saw there the two Kings;
        upon which she removed the head of the Jinni from her knee, and, having placed it on the ground, stood under the
        tree, and made signs to the two Kings, as though she would say, Come down, and fear not this ‘Efrit. They
        answered her, We conjure thee by Allah that thou excuse us in this matter. But she said, I conjure you by the
        same that ye come down; and if ye do not, I will rouse this ‘Efrit, and shall put you to a cruel death. So,
        being afraid, they came down to her; and, after they had remained with her as long as she required, she took
        from her pocket a purse, and drew out from this a string, upon which were ninety-eight seal-rings; and she said
        to them, Know ye what are these? They answered, We know not.—The owners of these rings, said she, have, all of
        them, been admitted to converse with me, like as ye have, unknown to this foolish ‘Efrit; therefore, give me
        your two rings, ye brothers. So they gave her their two rings from their fingers; and then she said to them,
        This ‘Efrit carried me off on my wedding-night, and put me in the box, and placed the box in the chest, and
        affixed to the chest seven locks, and deposited me thus imprisoned, in the bottom of the roaring sea, beneath
        the dashing waves; not knowing that, when one of our sex desires to accomplish any object, nothing can prevent
        her. In accordance with this, says one of the poets:
    </p>
    <p>
        Never trust in women; nor rely upon their vows; <br/>
        For their pleasure and displeasure depend upon their passions.<br/>
        They offer a false affection; for perfidy lurks within their clothing.<br/>
        By the tale of Yusuf be admonished, and guard against their stratagems.<br/>
        Dost thou not consider that Iblis ejected Adam by means of woman?
    </p>
    <p>
        And another poet says:— <br/>
        Abstain from censure; for it will strengthen the censured, and increase desire into violent passion.<br/>
        If I suffer such passion, my case is but the same that as of many a man before me:<br/>
        For greatly indeed to be wondered at is he who hath kept himself safe from women’s artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the two Kings heard these words from her lips they were struck with the utmost astonishment, and said, one
        to the other, If this is an ‘Efrit, and a greater calamity hath happened unto him than that which hath befallen
        us, this is a circumstance that should console us:—and immediately they departed, and returned to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as they had entered the palace, Shahriyar caused his wife to be beheaded, and in like manner the women
        and black slaves; and thenceforth he made it his regular custom, every time that he took a virgin to his bed, to
        kill her at the expiration of the night. Thus he continued to do during a period of three years; and the people
        raised an outcry against him, and fled with their daughters, and there remained not a virgin in the city of a
        sufficient age for marriage. Such was the case when the King ordered the Wezir to bring him a virgin according
        to his custom; and the Wezir went forth and searched, and found none; and he went back to his house enraged and
        vexed, fearing what the King might do to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now the Wezir had two daughters; the elder of whom was named Shahrazad; and the younger, Dunyzad. The former had
        read various books of histories, and the lives of preceding kings, and stories of past generations: it is
        asserted that she had collected together a thousand books of histories, relating to preceding generations and
        kings, and works of the poets: and she said to her father on this occasion, Why do I see thee thus changed, and
        oppressed with solicitude and sorrows? It has been said by one of the poets:—
    </p>
    <p>
        Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety, that anxiety will not last: <br/>
        As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Wezir heard these words from his daughter, he related to her all that had happened to him with regard
        to the King: upon which she said, By Allah, O my father, give me in marriage to this King: either I shall die,
        and be a ransom for one of the daughters of the Muslims, or I shall live, and be the cause of their deliverance
        from him. I conjure thee by Allah, exclaimed he, that thou expose not thyself to such peril:—but she said, It
        must be so. Then, said he, I fear for thee that the same will befall thee that happened in the case of the Ass
        and the Bull and the husbandman.—And what, she asked, was that, O my father?
    </p>
    <p>
        Know, O my daughter, said the Wezir, that there was a certain merchant, who possessed wealth and cattle, and had
        a wife and children; and God, whose name be exalted, had also endowed him with the knowledge of the languages of
        beasts and birds. The abode of this merchant was in the country; and he had, in his house, an ass and a bull.
        When the bull came to the place where the ass was tied, he found it swept and sprinkled; in his manger were
        sifted barley and sifted cut straw, and the ass was lying at his ease; his master being accustomed only to ride
        him occasionally, when business required, and soon to return: and it happened, one day, that the merchant
        overheard the bull saying to the ass, May thy food benefit thee! I am oppressed with fatigue, while thou art
        enjoying repose: thou eatest sifted barley, and men serve thee; and it is only occasionally that thy master
        rides thee, and returns; while I am continually employed in ploughing, and turning the mill.—The ass answered,
        When thou goest out to the field, and they place the yoke upon thy neck, lie down, and do not rise again, even
        if they beat thee; or, if thou rise, lie down a second time; and when they take thee back, and place the beans
        before thee, eat them not, as though thou wert sick: abstain from eating and drinking a day or two days, or
        three; and so shalt thou find rest from trouble and labour.—Accordingly, when the driver came to the bull with
        his fodder, he ate scarcely any of it; and on the morrow, when the driver came again to take him to plough, he
        found him apparently quite infirm: so the merchant said, Take the ass, and make him draw the plough in his stead
        all the day. The man did so; and when the ass returned at the close of the day, the bull thanked him for the
        favour he had conferred upon him by relieving him of his trouble on that day; but the ass returned him no
        answer, for he repented most grievously. On the next day, the ploughman came again, and took the ass, and
        ploughed with him till evening; and the ass returned with his neck flayed by the yoke, and reduced to an extreme
        state of weakness; and the bull looked upon him, and thanked and praised him. The ass exclaimed, I was living at
        ease, and nought but my meddling hath injured me! Then said he to the bull, Know that I am one who would give
        thee good advice: I heard our master say, If the bull rise not from his place, take him to the butcher, that he
        may kill him, and make a nat’ of his skin:—I am therefore in fear for thee, and so I have given thee advice; and
        peace be on thee!—When the bull heard these words of the ass, he thanked him, and said, To-morrow I will go with
        alacrity:—so he ate the whole of his fodder, and even licked the manger.—Their master, meanwhile, was listening
        to their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the following morning, the merchant and his wife went to the bull’s crib, and sat down there; and the driver
        came, and took out the bull; and when the bull saw his master, he shook his tail, and showed his alacrity by
        sounds and actions, bounding about in such a manner that the merchant laughed until he fell backwards. His wife,
        in surprise, asked him, At what dost thou laugh? He answered, At a thing that I have heard and seen; but I
        cannot reveal it; for if I did, I should die. She said, Thou must inform me of the cause of thy laughter, even
        if thou die.—I cannot reveal it, said he: the fear of death prevents me.—Thou laughedst only at me, she said;
        and she ceased not to urge and importune him until he was quite overcome and distracted. So he called together
        his children and sent for the Kadi and witnesses, that he might make his will, and reveal the secret to her, and
        die: for he loved her excessively, since she was the daughter of his paternal uncle, and the mother of his
        children, and he had lived with her to the age of a hundred and twenty years. Having assembled her family and
        his neighbours, he related to them his story, and told them that as soon as he revealed his secret he must die;
        upon which every one present said to her, We conjure thee by Allah that thou give up this affair, and let not
        thy husband, and the father of thy children, die. But she said, I will not desist until he tell me, though he
        die for it. So they ceased to solicit her; and the merchant left them, and went to the stable to perform the
        ablution, and then to return, and tell them the secret, and die.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now he had a cock, with fifty hens under him, and he had also a dog; and he heard the dog call to the cock, and
        reproach him, saying, Art thou happy when our master is going to die? The cock asked, How so?—and the dog
        related to him the story; upon which the cock exclaimed, By Allah! our master has little sense: I have fifty
        wives; and I please this, and provoke that; while he has but one one wife, and cannot manage this affair with
        her: why does he not take some twigs of the mulberry tree, and enter her chamber, and beat her until she dies or
        repents? She would never, after that ask him a question respecting anything.—And when the merchant heard the
        words of the cock, as he addressed the dog, he recovered his reason, and made up his mind to beat her.—Now, said
        the Wezir to his daughter Shahrazad, perhaps I may do to thee as the merchant did to his wife. She asked, And
        what did he? He answered, He entered her chamber after he had cut off some twigs of the mulberry tree, and
        hidden them there; and then said to her, Come into the chamber, that I may tell thee the secret while no one
        sees me, and then die:—and when she had entered, he locked the chamber door upon her, and beat her until she
        became almost senseless and cried out, I repent:—and she kissed his hands and his feet, and repented, and went
        out with him; and all the company, and her own family, rejoiced; and they lived together in the happiest manner
        until death.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Wezir’s daughter heard the words of her father, she said to him, It must be as I have requested. So he
        arrayed her, Shahriyar. Now she had given directions to her younger sister saying to her, When I have gone to
        the King, I will send to request thee to come; and when thou comest to me, and seest a convenient time, do thou
        say to me, O my sister, relate to me some strange story to beguile our waking hour:—and I will relate to thee a
        story that shall, if it be the will of God, be the means of procuring deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Her father, the Wezir, then took her to the King, who, when he saw him, was rejoiced, and said, Hast thou
        brought me what I desired? He answered Yes. When the King, therefore, introduced himself to her, she wept; and
        he said to her, What aileth thee? She answered, O King, I Have a young sister, and I wish to take leave of her.
        So the King sent to her; and she came to her sister, and embraced her, and sat near the foot of the bed; and
        after she had waited for a proper opportunity, she said, By Allah! O my sister, relate to us a story to beguile
        the waking hour of our night. Most willingly, answered Shahrazad, if this virtuous King permit me. And the King,
        hearing these words, and being restless, was pleased with the idea of listening to the story; and thus, on the
        first night of the thousand and one, Shahrazad commenced her recitations.
