        Political writers argue in regard to the love of liberty with the same philosophy that philosophers do in regard
        to the state of nature; by the things they see they judge of things very different which they have never seen,
        and they attribute to men a natural inclination to slavery, on account of the patience with which the slaves
        within their notice carry the yoke; not reflecting that it is with liberty as with innocence and virtue, the
        value of which is not known but by those who possess them, though the relish for them is lost with the things
        themselves. I know the charms of your country, said Brasidas to a satrap who was comparing the life of the
        Spartans with that of the Persepolites; but you can not know the pleasures of mine.

        As an unbroken courser erects his mane, paws the ground, and rages at the bare sight of the bit, while a trained
        horse patiently suffers both whip and spur, just so the barbarian will never reach his neck to the yoke which
        civilized man carries without murmuring but prefers the most stormy liberty to a calm subjection. It is not
        therefore by the servile disposition of enslaved nations that we must judge of the natural dispositions of man
        for or against slavery, but by the prodigies done by every free people to secure themselves from oppression. I
        know that the first are constantly crying up that peace and tranquillity they enjoy in their irons, and that
        miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant: but when I see the others sacrifice pleasures, peace, riches, power, and
        even life itself to the preservation of that single jewel so much slighted by those who have lost it; when I see
        free-born animals through a natural abhorrence of captivity dash their brains out against the bars of their
        prison; when I see multitudes of naked savages despise European pleasures and brave hunger, fire and sword, and
        death itself to preserve their independency; I feel that it belongs not to slaves to argue concerning liberty.

        As to paternal authority, from which several have derived absolute government and every other mode of society,
        it is sufficient, without having recourse to Locke and Sidney, to observe that nothing in the world differs more
        from the cruel spirit of despotism, than the gentleness of that authority, which looks more to the advantage of
        him who obeys than to the utility of him who commands; that by the law of nature the father continues master of
        his child no longer than the child stands in need of his assistance; that after that term they become equal, and
        that then the son, entirely independent of the father, owes him no obedience, but only respect. Gratitude is
        indeed a duty which we are bound to pay, but which benefactors can not exact. Instead of saying that civil
        society is derived from paternal authority, we should rather say that it is to the former that the latter owes
        its principal force: No one individual was acknowledged as the father of several other individuals, till they
        settled about him. The father’s goods, which he can indeed dispose of as he pleases, are the ties which hold his
        children to their dependence upon him, and he may divide his substance among them in proportion as they shall
        have deserved his attention by a continual deference to his commands. Now the subjects of a despotic chief, far
        from having any such favour to expect from him, as both themselves and all they have are his property, or at
        least are considered by him as such, are obliged to receive as a favour what he relinquishes to them of their
        own property. He does them justice when he strips them; he treats them with mercy when he suffers them to live.
        By continuing in this manner to compare facts with right, we should discover as little solidity as truth in the
        voluntary establishment of tyranny; and it would be a hard matter to prove the validity of a contract which was
        binding only on one side, in which one of the parties should stake everything and the other nothing, and which
        could turn out to the prejudice of him alone who had bound himself.

        This odious system is even, at this day, far from being that of wise and good monarchs, and especially of the
        kings of France, as may be seen by divers passages in their edicts, and particularly by that of a celebrated
        piece published in 1667 in the name and by the orders of Louis XIV. “Let it therefore not be said that the
        sovereign is not subject to the laws of his realm, since, that he is, is a maxim of the law of nations which
        flattery has sometimes attacked, but which good princes have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their
        realms. How much more reasonable is it to say with the sage Plato, that the perfect happiness of a state
        consists in the subjects obeying their prince, the prince obeying the laws, and the laws being equitable and
        always directed to the good of the public? I shall not stop to consider, if, liberty being the most noble
        faculty of man, it is not degrading one’s nature, reducing one’s self to the level of brutes, who are the slaves
        of instinct, and even offending the author of one’s being, to renounce without reserve the most precious of his
        gifts, and submit to the commission of all the crimes he has forbid us, merely to gratify a mad or a cruel
        master; and if this sublime artist ought to be more irritated at seeing his work destroyed than at seeing it
        dishonoured. I shall only ask what right those, who were not afraid thus to degrade themselves, could have to
        subject their dependants to the same ignominy, and renounce, in the name of their posterity, blessings for which
        it is not indebted to their liberality, and without which life itself must appear a burthen to all those who are
        worthy to live.

        Puffendorf says that, as we can transfer our property from one to another by contracts and conventions, we may
        likewise divest ourselves of our liberty in favour of other men. This, in my opinion, is a very poor way of
        arguing; for, in the first place, the property I cede to another becomes by such cession a thing quite foreign
        to me, and the abuse of which can no way affect me; but it concerns me greatly that my liberty is not abused,
        and I can not, without incurring the guilt of the crimes I may be forced to commit, expose myself to become the
        instrument of any. Besides, the right of property being of mere human convention and institution, every man may
        dispose as he pleases of what he possesses: But the case is otherwise with regard to the essential gifts of
        nature, such as life and liberty, which every man is permitted to enjoy, and of which it is doubtful at least
        whether any man has a right to divest himself: By giving up the one, we degrade our being; by giving up the
        other we annihilate it as much as it is our power to do so; and as no temporal enjoyments can indemnify us for
        the loss of either, it would be at once of fending both nature and reason to renounce them for any
        consideration. But though we could transfer our liberty as we do our substance, the difference would be very
        great with regard to our children, who enjoy our substance but by a cession of our right; whereas liberty being
        a blessing, which as men they hold from nature, their parents have no right to strip them of it; so that as to
        establish slavery it was necessary to do violence to nature, so it was necessary to alter nature to perpetuate
        such a right; and the jurisconsults, who have gravely pronounced that the child of a slave comes a slave into
        the world, have in other words decided, that a man does not come a man into the world.

        It therefore appears to me incontestably true, that not only governments did not begin by arbitrary power, which
        is but the corruption and extreme term of government, and at length brings it back to the law of the strongest,
        against which governments were at first the remedy, but even that, allowing they had commenced in this manner,
        such power being illegal in itself could never have served as a foundation to the rights of society, nor of
        course to the inequality of institution.
    </p>
    <p>
        I shall not now enter upon the inquiries which still remain to be made into the nature of the fundamental pacts
        of every kind of government, but, following the common opinion, confine myself in this place to the
        establishment of the political body as a real contract between the multitude and the chiefs elected by it. A
        contract by which both parties oblige themselves to the observance of the laws that are therein stipulated, and
        form the bands of their union. The multitude having, on occasion of the social relations between them,
        concentered all their wills in one person, all the articles, in regard to which this will explains itself,
        become so many fundamental laws, which oblige without exception all the members of the state, and one of which
        laws regulates the choice and the power of the magistrates appointed to look to the execution of the rest. This
        power extends to everything that can maintain the constitution, but extends to nothing that can alter it. To
        this power are added honours, that may render the laws and the ministers of them respectable; and the persons of
        the ministers are distinguished by certain prerogatives, which may make them amends for the great fatigues
        inseparable from a good administration. The magistrate, on his side, obliges himself not to use the power with
        which he is intrusted but conformably to the intention of his constituents, to maintain every one of them in the
        peaceable possession of his property, and upon all occasions prefer the good of the public to his own private
        interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before experience had demonstrated, or a thorough knowledge of the human heart had pointed out, the abuses
        inseparable from such a constitution, it must have appeared so much the more perfect, as those appointed to look
        to its preservation were themselves most concerned therein; for magistracy and its rights being built solely on
        the fundamental laws, as soon as these ceased to exist, the magistrates would cease to be lawful, the people
        would no longer be bound to obey them, and, as the essence of the state did not consist in the magistrates but
        in the laws, the members of it would immediately become entitled to their primitive and natural liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little reflection would afford us new arguments in confirmation of this truth, and the nature of the contract
        might alone convince us that it can not be irrevocable: for if there was no superior power capable of
        guaranteeing the fidelity of the contracting parties and of obliging them to fulfil their mutual engagements,
        they would remain sole judges in their own cause, and each of them would always have a right to renounce the
        contract, as soon as he discovered that the other had broke the conditions of it, or that these conditions
        ceased to suit his private convenience. Upon this principle, the right of abdication may probably be founded.
        Now, to consider as we do nothing but what is human in this institution, if the magistrate, who has all the
        power in his own hands, and who appropriates to himself all the advantages of the contract, has notwithstanding
        a right to divest himself of his authority; how much a better right must the people, who pay for all the faults
        of its chief, have to renounce their dependence upon him. But the shocking dissensions and disorders without
        number, which would be the necessary consequence of so dangerous a privilege, show more than anything else how
        much human governments stood in need of a more solid basis than that of mere reason, and how necessary it was
        for the public tranquillity, that the will of the Almighty should interpose to give to sovereign authority, a
        sacred and inviolable character, which should deprive subjects of the mischievous right to dispose of it to whom
        they pleased. If mankind had received no other advantages from religion, this alone would be sufficient to make
        them adopt and cherish it, since it is the means of saving more blood than fanaticism has been the cause of
        spilling. But to resume the thread of our hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
        The various forms of government owe their origin to the various degrees of inequality between the members, at
        the time they first coalesced into a political body. Where a man happened to be eminent for power, for virtue,
        for riches, or for credit, he became sole magistrate, and the state assumed a monarchical form; if many of
        pretty equal eminence out-topped all the rest, they were jointly elected, and this election produced an
        aristocracy; those, between whose fortune or talents there happened to be no such disproportion, and who had
        deviated less from the state of nature, retained in common the supreme administration, and formed a democracy.
        Time demonstrated which of these forms suited mankind best. Some remained altogether subject to the laws; others
        soon bowed their necks to masters. The former laboured to preserve their liberty; the latter thought of nothing
        but invading that of their neighbours, jealous at seeing others enjoy a blessing which themselves had lost. In a
        word, riches and conquest fell to the share of the one, and virtue and happiness to that of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        In these various modes of government the offices at first were all elective; and when riches did not
        preponderate, the preference was given to merit, which gives a natural ascendant, and to age, which is the
        parent of deliberateness in council, and experience in execution. The ancients among the Hebrews, the Geronts of
        Sparta, the Senate of Rome, nay, the very etymology of our word seigneur, show how much gray hairs were formerly
        respected. The oftener the choice fell upon old men, the oftener it became necessary to repeat it, and the more
        the trouble of such repetitions became sensible; electioneering took place; factions arose; the parties
        contracted ill-blood; civil wars blazed forth; the lives of the citizens were sacrificed to the pretended
        happiness of the state; and things at last came to such a pass, as to be ready to relapse into their primitive
        confusion. The ambition of the principal men induced them to take advantage of these circumstances to perpetuate
        the hitherto temporary charges in their families; the people already inured to dependence, accustomed to ease
        and the conveniences of life, and too much enervated to break their fetters, consented to the increase of their
        slavery for the sake of securing their tranquillity; and it is thus that chiefs, become hereditary, contracted
        the habit of considering magistracies as a family estate, and themselves as proprietors of those communities, of
        which at first they were but mere officers; to call their fellow-citizens their slaves; to look upon them, like
        so many cows or sheep, as a part of their substance; and to style themselves the peers of Gods, and Kings of
        Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
        By pursuing the progress of inequality in these different revolutions, we shall discover that the establishment
        of laws and of the right of property was the first term of it; the institution of magistrates the second; and
        the third and last the changing of legal into arbitrary power; so that the different states of rich and poor
        were authorized by the first epoch; those of powerful and weak by the second; and by the third those of master
        and slave, which formed the last degree of inequality, and the term in which all the rest at last end, till new
        revolutions entirely dissolve the government, or bring it back nearer to its legal constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
        To conceive the necessity of this progress, we are not so much to consider the motives for the establishment of
        political bodies, as the forms these bodies assume in their administration; and the inconveniences with which
        they are essentially attended; for those vices, which render social institutions necessary, are the same which
        render the abuse of such institutions unavoidable; and as (Sparta alone expected, whose laws chiefly regarded
        the education of children, and where Lycurgus established such manners and customs, as in a great measure made
        laws needless,) the laws, in general less strong than the passions, restrain men without changing them; it would
        be no hard matter to prove that every government, which carefully guarding against all alteration and corruption
        should scrupulously comply with the ends of its institution, was unnecessarily instituted; and that a country,
        where no one either eluded the laws, or made an ill use of magistracy, required neither laws nor magistrates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Political distinctions are necessarily attended with civil distinctions. The inequality between the people and
        the chiefs increase so fast as to be soon felt by the private members, and appears among them in a thousand
        shapes according to their passions, their talents, and the circumstances of affairs. The magistrate can not
        usurp any illegal power without making himself creatures, with whom he must divide it. Besides, the citizens of
        a free state suffer themselves to be oppressed merely in proportion as, hurried on by a blind ambition, and
        looking rather below than above them, they come to love authority more than independence. When they submit to
        fetters, ’tis only to be the better able to fetter others in their turn. It is no easy matter to make him obey,
        who does not wish to command; and the most refined policy would find it impossible to subdue those men, who only
        desire to be independent; but inequality easily gains ground among base and ambitious souls, ever ready to run
        the risks of fortune, and almost indifferent whether they command or obey, as she proves either favourable or
        adverse to them. Thus then there must have been a time, when the eyes of the people were bewitched to such a
        degree, that their rulers needed only to have said to the most pitiful wretch, “Be great you and all your
        posterity,” to make him immediately appear great in the eyes of every one as well as in his own; and his
        descendants took still more upon them, in proportion to their removes from him: the more distant and uncertain
        the cause, the greater the effect; the longer the line of drones a family produced, the more illustrious it was
        reckoned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Were this a proper place to enter into details, I could easily explain in what manner inequalities in point of
        credit and authority become unavoidable among private persons the moment that, united into one body, they are
        obliged to compare themselves one with another, and to note the differences which they find in the continual use
        every man must make of his neighbour. These differences are of several kinds; but riches, nobility or rank,
        power and personal merit, being in general the principal distinctions, by which men in society measure each
        other, I could prove that the harmony or conflict between these different forces is the surest indication of the
        good or bad original constitution of any state: I could make it appear that, as among these four kinds of
        inequality, personal qualities are the source of all the rest, riches is that in which they ultimately
        terminate, because, being the most immediately useful to the prosperity of individuals, and the most easy to
        communicate, they are made use of to purchase every other distinction. By this observation we are enabled to
        judge with tolerable exactness, how much any people has deviated from its primitive, institution and what steps
        it has still to make to the extreme term of corruption. I could show how much this universal desire of
        reputation, of honours, of preference, with which we are all devoured, exercises and compares our talents and
        our forces: how much it excites and multiplies our passions; and, by creating an universal competition,
        rivalship, or rather enmity among men, how many disappoinments, successes, and catastrophes of every kind it
        daily causes among the innumerable pretenders whom it engages in the same career. I could show that it is to
        this itch of being spoken of, to this fury of distinguishing ourselves which seldom or never gives us a moment’s
        respite, that we owe both the best and the worst things among us, our virtues and our vices, our sciences and
        our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers; that is to say, a great many bad things to a very few good
        ones. I could prove, in short, that if we behold a handful of rich and powerful men seated on the pinnacle of
        fortune and greatness, while the crowd grovel in obscurity and want, it is merely because the first, prize what
        they enjoy, but in the same degree that others want it, and that, without changing their condition, they would
        cease to be happy the minute the people ceased to be miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
        But these details would alone furnish sufficient matter for a more considerable work, in which might be weighed
        the advantages and disadvantages of every species of government, relatively to the rights of man in a state of
        nature, and might likewise be unveiled all the different faces under which inequality has appeared to this day,
        and may hereafter appear to the end of time, according to the nature of these several governments, and the
        revolutions, time must unavoidably occasion in them. We should then see the multitude oppressed by domestic
        tyrants in consequence of those very precautions taken by them to guard against foreign masters. We should see
        oppression increase continually without its being ever possible for the oppressed to know where it would stop,
        nor what lawful means they had left to check its progress. We should see the rights of citizens, and the
        liberties of nations extinguished by slow degrees, and the groans, and protestations and appeals of the weak
        treated as seditious murmurings. We should see policy confine to a mercernary portion of the people the honour
        of defending the common sense. We should see imposts made necessary by such measures, the disheartened
        husbandman desert his field even in time of peace, and quit the plough to take up the sword. We should see fatal
        and whimsical rules laid down concerning the point of honour. We should see the champions of their country
        sooner or later become her enemies, and perpetually holding their poniards to the breasts of their fellow
        citizenry. Nay, the time would come when they might be heard to say to the oppressor of their country. <br/>
        Pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis <br/>
        Condere me jubeas, gravidæque in viscera partu <br/>
        Conjugis, in vitâ peragam tamen omnia dextrâ.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the vast inequality of conditions and fortunes, from the great variety of passions and of talents, of
        useless arts, of pernicious arts, of frivolous sciences, would issue clouds of prejudices equally contrary to
        reason, to happiness, to virtue. We should see the chiefs foment everything that tends to weaken men formed into
        societies by dividing them; everything that, while it gives society an air of apparent harmony, sows in it the
        seeds of real division; everything that can inspire the different orders with mutual distrust and hatred by an
        opposition of their rights and interest, and of course strengthen that power which contains them all.
    </p>
    <p>
        ’Tis from the bosom of this disorder and these revolutions, that despotism gradually rearing up her hideous
        crest, and devouring in every part of the state all that still remained sound and untainted, would at last issue
        to trample upon the laws and the people, and establish herself upon the ruins of the republic. The times
        immediately preceding this last alteration would be times of calamity and trouble: but at last everything would
        be swallowed up by the monster; and the people would no longer have chiefs or laws, but only tyrants. At this
        fatal period all regard to virtue and manners would likewise disappear; for despotism, cui ex honesto nulla est
        spes, tolerates no other master, wherever it reigns; the moment it speaks, probity and duty lose all their
        influence, and the blindest obedience is the only virtue the miserable slaves have left them to practise.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the last term of inequality, the extreme point which closes the circle and meets that from which we set
        out. ’Tis here that all private men return to their primitive equality, because they are no longer of any
        account; and that, the subjects having no longer any law but that of their master, nor the master any other law
        but his passions, all notions of good and principles of justice again disappear. ’Tis here that everything
        returns to the sole law of the strongest, and of course to a new state of nature different from that with which
        we began, in as much as the first was the state of nature in its purity, and the last the consequence of
        excessive corruption. There is, in other respects, so little difference between these two states, and the
        contract of government is so much dissolved by despotism, that the despot is no longer master than he continues
        the strongest, and that, as soon as his slaves can expel him, they may do it without his having the least right
        to complain of their using him ill. The insurrection, which ends in the death or despotism of a sultan, is as
        juridical an act as any by which the day before he disposed of the lives and fortunes of his subjects. Force
        alone upheld him, force alone overturns him. Thus all things take place and succeed in their natural order; and
        whatever may be the upshot of these hasty and frequent revolutions, no one man has reason to complain of
        another’s injustice, but only of his own indiscretion or bad fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
        By thus discovering and following the lost and forgotten tracks, by which man from the natural must have arrived
        at the civil state; by restoring, with the intermediate positions which I have been just indicating, those which
        want of leisure obliges me to suppress, or which my imagination has not suggested, every attentive reader must
        unavoidably be struck at the immense space which separates these two states. ’Tis in this slow succession of
        things he may meet with the solution of an infinite number of problems in morality and politics, which
        philosophers are puzzled to solve. He will perceive that, the mankind of one age not being the mankind of
        another, the reason why Diogenes could not find a man was, that he sought among his cotemporaries the man of an
        earlier period: Cato, he will then see, fell with Rome and with liberty, because he did not suit the age in
        which he lived; and the greatest of men served only to astonish that world, which would have cheerfully obeyed
        him, had he come into it five hundred years earlier. In a word, he will find himself in a condition to
        understand how the soul and the passions of men by insensible alterations change as it were their nature; how it
        comes to pass, that at the long run our wants and our pleasures change objects; that, original man vanishing by
        degrees, society no longer offers to our inspection but an assemblage of artificial men and factitious passions,
        which are the work of all these new relations, and have no foundation in nature. Reflection teaches us nothing
        on that head, but what experience perfectly confirms. Savage man and civilised man differ so much at bottom in
        point of inclinations and passions, that what constitutes the supreme happiness of the one would reduce the
        other to despair. The first sighs for nothing but repose and liberty; he desires only to live, and to be exempt
        from labour; nay, the ataraxy of the most confirmed Stoic falls short of his consummate indifference for every
        other object. On the contrary, the citizen always in motion, is perpetually sweating and toiling, and racking
        his brains to find out occupations still more laborious: He continues a drudge to his last minute; nay, he
        courts death to be able to live, or renounces life to acquire immortality. He cringes to men in power whom he
        hates, and to rich men whom he despises; he sticks at nothing to have the honour of serving them; he is not
        ashamed to value himself on his own weakness and the protection they afford him; and proud of his chains, he
        speaks with disdain of those who have not the honour of being the partner of his bondage. What a spectacle must
        the painful and envied labours of an European minister of state form in the eyes of a Caribbean! How many cruel
        deaths would not this indolent savage prefer to such a horrid life, which very often is not even sweetened by
        the pleasure of doing good? But to see the drift of so many cares, his mind should first have affixed some
        meaning to these words power and reputation; he should be apprised that there are men who consider as something
        the looks of the rest of mankind, who know how to be happy and satisfied with themselves on the testimony of
        others sooner than upon their own. In fact, the real source of all those differences, is that the savage lives
        within himself, whereas the citizen, constantly beside himself, knows only how to live in the opinion of others;
        insomuch that it is, if I may say so, merely from their judgment that he derives the consciousness of his own
        existence. It is foreign to my subject to show how this disposition engenders so much indifference for god and
        evil, notwithstanding so many and such fine discourses of morality; how everything, being reduced to
        appearances, becomes mere art and mummery; honour, friendship, virtue, and often vice itself, which we at last
        learn the secret to boast of; how, in short, ever inquiring of others what we are, and never daring to question
        ourselves on so delicate a point, in the midst of so much philosophy, humanity, and politeness, and so many
        sublime maxims, we have nothing to show for ourselves but a deceitful and frivolous exterior, honour without
        virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasure without happiness. It is sufficient that I have proved that this is
        not the original condition of man, and that it is merely the spirit of society, and the inequality which society
        engenders, that thus change and transform all our natural inclinations.

        I have endeavoured to exhibit the origin and progress of inequality, the institution and abuse of political
        societies, as far as these things are capable of being deduced from the nature of man by the mere light of
        reason, and independently of those sacred maxims which give to the sovereign authority the sanction of divine
        right. It follows from this picture, that as there is scarce any inequality among men in a state of nature, all
        that which we now behold owes its force and its growth to the development of our faculties and the improvement
        of our understanding, and at last becomes permanent and lawful by the establishment of property and of laws. It
        likewise follows that moral inequality, authorised by any right that is merely positive, clashes with natural
        right, as often as it does not combine in the same proportion with physical inequality: a distinction which
        sufficiently determines, what we are able to think in that respect of that kind of inequality which obtains in
        all civilised nations, since it is evidently against the law of nature that infancy should command old age,
        folly conduct wisdom, and a handful of men should be ready to choke with superfluities, while the famished
        multitude want the commonest necessaries of life.
