        “’T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs <br/>
        Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,<br/>
        When Hector’s ghost before my sight appears:<br/>
        A bloody shroud he seem’d, and bath’d in tears;<br/>
        Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<br/>
        Thessalian coursers dragg’d him o’er the plain.<br/>
        Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust<br/>
        Thro’ the bor’d holes; his body black with dust;<br/>
        Unlike that Hector who return’d from toils<br/>
        Of war, triumphant, in Æacian spoils,<br/>
        Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,<br/>
        And launch’d against their navy Phrygian fire.<br/>
        His hair and beard stood stiffen’d with his gore;<br/>
        And all the wounds he for his country bore<br/>
        Now stream’d afresh, and with new purple ran.<br/>
        I wept to see the visionary man,<br/>
        And, while my trance continued, thus began:<br/>
        ‘O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,<br/>
        Thy father’s champion, and thy country’s joy!<br/>
        O, long expected by thy friends! from whence<br/>
        Art thou so late return’d for our defense?<br/>
        Do we behold thee, wearied as we are<br/>
        With length of labors, and with toils of war?<br/>
        After so many fun’rals of thy own<br/>
        Art thou restor’d to thy declining town?<br/>
        But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace<br/>
        Deforms the manly features of thy face?’
    </p>
    <p>
        “To this the specter no reply did frame,<br/>
        But answer’d to the cause for which he came,<br/>
        And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<br/>
        This warning in these mournful words express’d:<br/>
        ‘O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,<br/>
        The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<br/>
        The foes already have possess’d the wall;<br/>
        Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<br/>
        Enough is paid to Priam’s royal name,<br/>
        More than enough to duty and to fame.<br/>
        If by a mortal hand my father’s throne<br/>
        Could be defended, ’t was by mine alone.<br/>
        Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<br/>
        And gives her gods companions of thy fate:<br/>
        From their assistance happier walls expect,<br/>
        Which, wand’ring long, at last thou shalt erect.’<br/>
        He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,<br/>
        The venerable statues of the gods,<br/>
        With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,<br/>
        The wreaths and relics of th’ immortal fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Now peals of shouts come thund’ring from afar,<br/>
        Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:<br/>
        The noise approaches, tho’ our palace stood<br/>
        Aloof from streets, encompass’d with a wood.<br/>
        Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th’ alarms<br/>
        Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.<br/>
        Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,<br/>
        But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,<br/>
        And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.<br/>
        Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,<br/>
        Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;<br/>
        Or deluges, descending on the plains,<br/>
        Sweep o’er the yellow year, destroy the pains<br/>
        Of lab’ring oxen and the peasant’s gains;<br/>
        Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away<br/>
        Flocks, folds, and trees, an undistinguish’d prey:<br/>
        The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far<br/>
        The wasteful ravage of the wat’ry war.<br/>
        Then Hector’s faith was manifestly clear’d,<br/>
        And Grecian frauds in open light appear’d.<br/>
        The palace of Deiphobus ascends<br/>
        In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.<br/>
        Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright<br/>
        With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light.<br/>
        New clamors and new clangors now arise,<br/>
        The sound of trumpets mix’d with fighting cries.<br/>
        With frenzy seiz’d, I run to meet th’ alarms,<br/>
        Resolv’d on death, resolv’d to die in arms,<br/>
        But first to gather friends, with them t’ oppose<br/>
        (If fortune favor’d) and repel the foes;<br/>
        Spurr’d by my courage, by my country fir’d,<br/>
        With sense of honor and revenge inspir’d.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Pantheus, Apollo’s priest, a sacred name,<br/>
        Had scap’d the Grecian swords, and pass’d the flame:<br/>
        With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,<br/>
        And by the hand his tender grandson led.<br/>
        ‘What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?<br/>
        Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?’<br/>
        Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:<br/>
        ‘Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<br/>
        The fatal day, th’ appointed hour, is come,<br/>
        When wrathful Jove’s irrevocable doom<br/>
        Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<br/>
        The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<br/>
        And armed hosts, an unexpected force,<br/>
        Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.<br/>
        Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about<br/>
        The flames; and foes for entrance press without,<br/>
        With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<br/>
        More than from Argos or Mycenæ came.<br/>
        To sev’ral posts their parties they divide;<br/>
        Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<br/>
        The bold they kill, th’ unwary they surprise;<br/>
        Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.<br/>
        The warders of the gate but scarce maintain<br/>
        Th’ unequal combat, and resist in vain.’
    </p>
    <p>
        “I heard; and Heav’n, that well-born souls inspires,<br/>
        Prompts me thro’ lifted swords and rising fires<br/>
        To run where clashing arms and clamor calls,<br/>
        And rush undaunted to defend the walls.<br/>
        Ripheus and Iph’itus by my side engage,<br/>
        For valor one renown’d, and one for age.<br/>
        Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<br/>
        My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;<br/>
        With young Coroebus, who by love was led<br/>
        To win renown and fair Cassandra’s bed,<br/>
        And lately brought his troops to Priam’s aid,<br/>
        Forewarn’d in vain by the prophetic maid.<br/>
        Whom when I saw resolv’d in arms to fall,<br/>
        And that one spirit animated all:<br/>
        ‘Brave souls!’ said I,—’but brave, alas! in vain—<br/>
        Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.<br/>
        You see the desp’rate state of our affairs,<br/>
        And heav’n’s protecting pow’rs are deaf to pray’rs.<br/>
        The passive gods behold the Greeks defile<br/>
        Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<br/>
        Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br/>
        To save a sinking town, involv’d in fire.<br/>
        Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<br/>
        Despair of life the means of living shows.’<br/>
        So bold a speech incourag’d their desire<br/>
        Of death, and added fuel to their fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        “As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<br/>
        Scour thro’ the fields, nor fear the stormy night—<br/>
        Their whelps at home expect the promis’d food,<br/>
        And long to temper their dry chaps in blood—<br/>
        So rush’d we forth at once; resolv’d to die,<br/>
        Resolv’d, in death, the last extremes to try.<br/>
        We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare<br/>
        Th’ unequal combat in the public square:<br/>
        Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<br/>
        What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br/>
        What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?<br/>
        An ancient and imperial city falls:<br/>
        The streets are fill’d with frequent funerals;<br/>
        Houses and holy temples float in blood,<br/>
        And hostile nations make a common flood.<br/>
        Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br/>
        The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors mourn.<br/>
        Ours take new courage from despair and night:<br/>
        Confus’d the fortune is, confus’d the fight.<br/>
        All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;<br/>
        And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.<br/>
        Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<br/>
        Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.<br/>
        ‘From whence,’ said he, ‘my friends, this long delay?<br/>
        You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br/>
        Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br/>
        And you, like truants, come too late ashore.’<br/>
        He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br/>
        Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<br/>
        Amaz’d, he would have shunn’d th’ unequal fight;<br/>
        But we, more num’rous, intercept his flight.<br/>
        As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<br/>
        Has with unwary footing press’d a snake;<br/>
        He starts aside, astonish’d, when he spies<br/>
        His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<br/>
        So from our arms surpris’d Androgeos flies.<br/>
        In vain; for him and his we compass’d round,<br/>
        Possess’d with fear, unknowing of the ground,<br/>
        And of their lives an easy conquest found.<br/>
        Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil’d.<br/>
        Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil’d,<br/>
        Swoln with success, and of a daring mind,<br/>
        This new invention fatally design’d.<br/>
        ‘My friends,’ said he, ‘since Fortune shows the way,<br/>
        ’T is fit we should th’ auspicious guide obey.<br/>
        For what has she these Grecian arms bestow’d,<br/>
        But their destruction, and the Trojans’ good?<br/>
        Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<br/>
        Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<br/>
        They find us arms.’ This said, himself he dress’d<br/>
        In dead Androgeos’ spoils, his upper vest,<br/>
        His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.<br/>
        Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<br/>
        Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<br/>
        Mix’d with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br/>
        Flatter’d with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<br/>
        Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br/>
        And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<br/>
        Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<br/>
        Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<br/>
        And some, oppress’d with more ignoble fear,<br/>
        Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.<br/>
        “But, ah! what use of valor can be made,<br/>
        When heav’n’s propitious pow’rs refuse their aid!<br/>
        Behold the royal prophetess, the fair<br/>
        Cassandra, dragg’d by her dishevel’d hair,<br/>
        Whom not Minerva’s shrine, nor sacred bands,<br/>
        In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:<br/>
        On heav’n she cast her eyes, she sigh’d, she cried—<br/>
        ’T was all she could—her tender arms were tied.<br/>
        So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;<br/>
        But, fir’d with rage, distracted with despair,<br/>
        Amid the barb’rous ravishers he flew:<br/>
        Our leader’s rash example we pursue.<br/>
        But storms of stones, from the proud temple’s height,<br/>
        Pour down, and on our batter’d helms alight:<br/>
        We from our friends receiv’d this fatal blow,<br/>
        Who thought us Grecians, as we seem’d in show.<br/>
        They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;<br/>
        And ours beneath the pond’rous ruin lie.<br/>
        Then, mov’d with anger and disdain, to see<br/>
        Their troops dispers’d, the royal virgin free,<br/>
        The Grecians rally, and their pow’rs unite,<br/>
        With fury charge us, and renew the fight.<br/>
        The brother kings with Ajax join their force,<br/>
        And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<br/>
        Contending for the kingdom of the sky,<br/>
        South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;<br/>
        The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:<br/>
        Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,<br/>
        And, mix’d with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.<br/>
        The troops we squander’d first again appear<br/>
        From several quarters, and enclose the rear.<br/>
        They first observe, and to the rest betray,<br/>
        Our diff’rent speech; our borrow’d arms survey.<br/>
        Oppress’d with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,<br/>
        At Pallas’ altar, by Peneleus pierc’d.<br/>
        Then Ripheus follow’d, in th’ unequal fight;<br/>
        Just of his word, observant of the right:<br/>
        Heav’n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,<br/>
        With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.<br/>
        Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands<br/>
        Of awful Phœbus, sav’d from impious hands.<br/>
        Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,<br/>
        What I perform’d, and what I suffer’d there;<br/>
        No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,<br/>
        Expos’d to death, and prodigal of life;<br/>
        Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<br/>
        I strove to have deserv’d the death I sought.<br/>
        But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<br/>
        Borne off to distance by the growing tide,<br/>
        Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,<br/>
        With Pelias wounded, and without defense.<br/>
        New clamors from th’ invested palace ring:<br/>
        We run to die, or disengage the king.<br/>
        So hot th’ assault, so high the tumult rose,<br/>
        While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose<br/>
        As all the Dardan and Argolic race<br/>
        Had been contracted in that narrow space;<br/>
        Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,<br/>
        And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.<br/>
        Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,<br/>
        Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:<br/>
        Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,<br/>
        Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;<br/>
        Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th’ ascent,<br/>
        While with their right they seize the battlement.<br/>
        From their demolish’d tow’rs the Trojans throw<br/>
        Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;<br/>
        And heavy beams and rafters from the sides<br/>
        (Such arms their last necessity provides)<br/>
        And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<br/>
        The marks of state and ancient royalty.<br/>
        The guards below, fix’d in the pass, attend<br/>
        The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.<br/>
        Renew’d in courage with recover’d breath,<br/>
        A second time we ran to tempt our death,<br/>
        To clear the palace from the foe, succeed<br/>
        The weary living, and revenge the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
        “A postern door, yet unobserv’d and free,<br/>
        Join’d by the length of a blind gallery,<br/>
        To the king’s closet led: a way well known<br/>
        To Hector’s wife, while Priam held the throne,<br/>
        Thro’ which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<br/>
        To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire’s queen.<br/>
        Thro’ this we pass, and mount the tow’r, from whence<br/>
        With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense.<br/>
        From this the trembling king had oft descried<br/>
        The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.<br/>
        Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,<br/>
        Then, wrenching with our hands, th’ assault renew;<br/>
        And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<br/>
        We push them headlong with our arms and feet.<br/>
        The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,<br/>
        Nor thunder louder than the ruin’d wall:<br/>
        Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath<br/>
        Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death.<br/>
        Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;<br/>
        We cease not from above, nor they below relent.<br/>
        Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat’ning loud,<br/>
        With glitt’ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.<br/>
        So shines, renew’d in youth, the crested snake,<br/>
        Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,<br/>
        And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<br/>
        Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<br/>
        Restor’d with pois’nous herbs, his ardent sides<br/>
        Reflect the sun; and rais’d on spires he rides;<br/>
        High o’er the grass, hissing he rolls along,<br/>
        And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<br/>
        Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,<br/>
        His father’s charioteer, together run<br/>
        To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry<br/>
        Rush on in crowds, and the barr’d passage free.<br/>
        Ent’ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<br/>
        And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<br/>
        Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<br/>
        And with his ax repeated strokes bestows<br/>
        On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,<br/>
        Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.<br/>
        He hews apace; the double bars at length<br/>
        Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.<br/>
        A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal’d<br/>
        Appear, and all the palace is reveal’d;<br/>
        The halls of audience, and of public state,<br/>
        And where the lonely queen in secret sate.<br/>
        Arm’d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,<br/>
        With not a door, and scarce a space, between.<br/>
        The house is fill’d with loud laments and cries,<br/>
        And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;<br/>
        The fearful matrons run from place to place,<br/>
        And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.<br/>
        The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,<br/>
        And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<br/>
        Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:<br/>
        The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.<br/>
        In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;<br/>
        Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.<br/>
        Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood<br/>
        Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;<br/>
        Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<br/>
        And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.<br/>
        These eyes beheld him when he march’d between<br/>
        The brother kings: I saw th’ unhappy queen,<br/>
        The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,<br/>
        To stain his hallow’d altar with his brood.<br/>
        The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,<br/>
        So large a promise, of a progeny),<br/>
        The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<br/>
        Fell the reward of the proud victor’s toils.<br/>
        Where’er the raging fire had left a space,<br/>
        The Grecians enter and possess the place.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Perhaps you may of Priam’s fate enquire.<br/>
        He, when he saw his regal town on fire,<br/>
        His ruin’d palace, and his ent’ring foes,<br/>
        On ev’ry side inevitable woes,<br/>
        In arms, disus’d, invests his limbs, decay’d,<br/>
        Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.<br/>
        His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;<br/>
        Loaded, not arm’d, he creeps along with pain,<br/>
        Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!<br/>
        Uncover’d but by heav’n, there stood in view<br/>
        An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,<br/>
        Dodder’d with age, whose boughs encompass round<br/>
        The household gods, and shade the holy ground.<br/>
        Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train<br/>
        Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<br/>
        Driv’n like a flock of doves along the sky,<br/>
        Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.<br/>
        The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,<br/>
        And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<br/>
        ‘What rage,’ she cried, ‘has seiz’d my husband’s mind?<br/>
        What arms are these, and to what use design’d?<br/>
        These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<br/>
        Ev’n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.<br/>
        With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,<br/>
        Or in one common fate with us be join’d.’<br/>
        She said, and with a last salute embrac’d<br/>
        The poor old man, and by the laurel plac’d.<br/>
        Behold! Polites, one of Priam’s sons,<br/>
        Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<br/>
        Thro’ swords and foes, amaz’d and hurt, he flies<br/>
        Thro’ empty courts and open galleries.<br/>
        Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,<br/>
        And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.<br/>
        The youth, transfix’d, with lamentable cries,<br/>
        Expires before his wretched parent’s eyes:<br/>
        Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,<br/>
        The fear of death gave place to nature’s law;<br/>
        And, shaking more with anger than with age,<br/>
        ‘The gods,’ said he, ‘requite thy brutal rage!<br/>
        As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,<br/>
        If there be gods in heav’n, and gods be just—<br/>
        Who tak’st in wrongs an insolent delight;<br/>
        With a son’s death t’ infect a father’s sight.<br/>
        Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire<br/>
        To call thee his—not he, thy vaunted sire,<br/>
        Thus us’d my wretched age: the gods he fear’d,<br/>
        The laws of nature and of nations heard.<br/>
        He cheer’d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<br/>
        The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;<br/>
        Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<br/>
        And sent me back in safety from his tent.’<br/>
        “This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<br/>
        Which, flutt’ring, seem’d to loiter as it flew:<br/>
        Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,<br/>
        And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Then Pyrrhus thus: ‘Go thou from me to fate,<br/>
        And to my father my foul deeds relate.<br/>
        Now die!’ With that he dragg’d the trembling sire,<br/>
        Slidd’ring thro’ clotter’d blood and holy mire,<br/>
        (The mingled paste his murder’d son had made,)<br/>
        Haul’d from beneath the violated shade,<br/>
        And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.<br/>
        His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,<br/>
        His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<br/>
        Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:<br/>
        The lukewarm blood came rushing thro’ the wound,<br/>
        And sanguine streams distain’d the sacred ground.<br/>
        Thus Priam fell, and shar’d one common fate<br/>
        With Troy in ashes, and his ruin’d state:<br/>
        He, who the scepter of all Asia sway’d,<br/>
        Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey’d.<br/>
        On the bleak shore now lies th’ abandon’d king,<br/>
        A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood<br/>
        Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:<br/>
        My father’s image fill’d my pious mind,<br/>
        Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<br/>
        Again I thought on my forsaken wife,<br/>
        And trembled for my son’s abandon’d life.<br/>
        I look’d about, but found myself alone,<br/>
        Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.<br/>
        Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress’d,<br/>
        Leap’d headlong from the heights; the flames consum’d the rest.<br/>
        Thus, wand’ring in my way, without a guide,<br/>
        The graceless Helen in the porch I spied<br/>
        Of Vesta’s temple; there she lurk’d alone;<br/>
        Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<br/>
        But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,<br/>
        That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<br/>
        For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<br/>
        More dreads the vengeance of her injur’d lord;<br/>
        Ev’n by those gods who refug’d her abhorr’d.<br/>
        Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<br/>
        Resolv’d to give her guilt the due reward:<br/>
        ‘Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<br/>
        And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<br/>
        Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<br/>
        In state attended with a captive crew,<br/>
        While unreveng’d the good old Priam falls,<br/>
        And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<br/>
        For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<br/>
        Were swell’d with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<br/>
        ’T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,<br/>
        And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<br/>
        Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<br/>
        Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<br/>
        The punish’d crime shall set my soul at ease,<br/>
        And murm’ring manes of my friends appease.’<br/>
        Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<br/>
        Spread o’er the place; and, shining heav’nly bright,<br/>
        My mother stood reveal’d before my sight<br/>
        Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<br/>
        Not her own star confess’d a light so clear:<br/>
        Great in her charms, as when on gods above<br/>
        She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<br/>
        She held my hand, the destin’d blow to break;<br/>
        Then from her rosy lips began to speak:<br/>
        ‘My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<br/>
        Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<br/>
        Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<br/>
        Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<br/>
        Look if your helpless father yet survive,<br/>
        Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<br/>
        Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<br/>
        And these had perish’d in the nightly war,<br/>
        But for my presence and protecting care.<br/>
        Not Helen’s face, nor Paris, was in fault;<br/>
        But by the gods was this destruction brought.<br/>
        Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<br/>
        The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<br/>
        Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<br/>
        The shape of each avenging deity.<br/>
        Enlighten’d thus, my just commands fulfil,<br/>
        Nor fear obedience to your mother’s will.<br/>
        Where yon disorder’d heap of ruin lies,<br/>
        Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise—<br/>
        Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,<br/>
        Below the wall’s foundation drives his mace,<br/>
        And heaves the building from the solid base.<br/>
        Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands<br/>
        Full in the Scæan gate, with loud commands,<br/>
        Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<br/>
        See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<br/>
        Bestrides the tow’r, refulgent thro’ the cloud:<br/>
        See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<br/>
        And arms against the town the partial deities.<br/>
        Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:<br/>
        Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<br/>
        Haste; and a mother’s care your passage shall befriend.’<br/>
        She said, and swiftly vanish’d from my sight,<br/>
        Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<br/>
        I look’d, I listen’d; dreadful sounds I hear;<br/>
        And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<br/>
        Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),<br/>
        And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<br/>
        Rent like a mountain ash, which dar’d the winds,<br/>
        And stood the sturdy strokes of lab’ring hinds.<br/>
        About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<br/>
        The stumps are pierc’d with oft-repeated wounds:<br/>
        The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<br/>
        Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.<br/>
        To their united force it yields, tho’ late,<br/>
        And mourns with mortal groans th’ approaching fate:<br/>
        The roots no more their upper load sustain;<br/>
        But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro’ the plain.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Descending thence, I scape thro’ foes and fire:<br/>
        Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.<br/>
        Arriv’d at home, he, for whose only sake,<br/>
        Or most for his, such toils I undertake,<br/>
        The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,<br/>
        I purpos’d to secure on Ida’s height,<br/>
        Refus’d the journey, resolute to die<br/>
        And add his fun’rals to the fate of Troy,<br/>
        Rather than exile and old age sustain.<br/>
        ‘Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev’ry vein.<br/>
        Had Heav’n decreed that I should life enjoy,<br/>
        Heav’n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.<br/>
        ’T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,<br/>
        Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.<br/>
        Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,<br/>
        And give this useless corpse a long adieu.<br/>
        These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;<br/>
        At least the pitying foes will aid my death,<br/>
        To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:<br/>
        As for my sepulcher, let Heav’n take care.<br/>
        ’T is long since I, for my celestial wife<br/>
        Loath’d by the gods, have dragg’d a ling’ring life;<br/>
        Since ev’ry hour and moment I expire,<br/>
        Blasted from heav’n by Jove’s avenging fire.’<br/>
        This oft repeated, he stood fix’d to die:<br/>
        Myself, my wife, my son, my family,<br/>
        Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry—<br/>
        ‘What, will he still persist, on death resolve,<br/>
        And in his ruin all his house involve!’<br/>
        He still persists his reasons to maintain;<br/>
        Our pray’rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Urg’d by despair, again I go to try<br/>
        The fate of arms, resolv’d in fight to die:<br/>
        ‘What hope remains, but what my death must give?<br/>
        Can I, without so dear a father, live?<br/>
        You term it prudence, what I baseness call:<br/>
        Could such a word from such a parent fall?<br/>
        If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,<br/>
        That nothing should of ruin’d Troy remain,<br/>
        And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,<br/>
        The way to death is wide, th’ approaches near:<br/>
        For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,<br/>
        Reeking with Priam’s blood—the wretch who slew<br/>
        The son (inhuman) in the father’s view,<br/>
        And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.<br/>
        O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;<br/>
        Your gift was undesir’d, and came too late!<br/>
        Did you, for this, unhappy me convey<br/>
        Thro’ foes and fires, to see my house a prey?<br/>
        Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,<br/>
        Welt’ring in blood, each other’s arms infold?<br/>
        Haste! gird my sword, tho’ spent and overcome:<br/>
        ’T is the last summons to receive our doom.<br/>
        I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!<br/>
        Not unreveng’d the foe shall see my fall.<br/>
        Restore me to the yet unfinish’d fight:<br/>
        My death is wanting to conclude the night.’<br/>
        Arm’d once again, my glitt’ring sword I wield,<br/>
        While th’ other hand sustains my weighty shield,<br/>
        And forth I rush to seek th’ abandon’d field.<br/>
        I went; but sad Creusa stopp’d my way,<br/>
        And cross the threshold in my passage lay,<br/>
        Embrac’d my knees, and, when I would have gone,<br/>
        Shew’d me my feeble sire and tender son:<br/>
        ‘If death be your design, at least,’ said she,<br/>
        ‘Take us along to share your destiny.<br/>
        If any farther hopes in arms remain,<br/>
        This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.<br/>
        To whom do you expose your father’s life,<br/>
        Your son’s, and mine, your now forgotten wife!’<br/>
        While thus she fills the house with clam’rous cries,<br/>
        Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:<br/>
        For, while I held my son, in the short space<br/>
        Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;<br/>
        Strange to relate, from young Iulus’ head<br/>
        A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<br/>
        Around his brows, and on his temples fed.<br/>
        Amaz’d, with running water we prepare<br/>
        To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<br/>
        But old Anchises, vers’d in omens, rear’d<br/>
        His hands to heav’n, and this request preferr’d:<br/>
        ‘If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<br/>
        Thy will; if piety can pray’rs commend,<br/>
        Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas’d to send.’<br/>
        Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<br/>
        A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:<br/>
        There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,<br/>
        Which on the winged lightning seem’d to fly;<br/>
        From o’er the roof the blaze began to move,<br/>
        And, trailing, vanish’d in th’ Idæan grove.<br/>
        It swept a path in heav’n, and shone a guide,<br/>
        Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The good old man with suppliant hands implor’d<br/>
        The gods’ protection, and their star ador’d.<br/>
        ‘Now, now,’ said he, ‘my son, no more delay!<br/>
        I yield, I follow where Heav’n shews the way.<br/>
        Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,<br/>
        And guard this relic of the Trojan race,<br/>
        This tender child! These omens are your own,<br/>
        And you can yet restore the ruin’d town.<br/>
        At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:<br/>
        I stand resign’d, and am prepar’d to go.’
    </p>
    <p>
        “He said. The crackling flames appear on high.<br/>
        And driving sparkles dance along the sky.<br/>
        With Vulcan’s rage the rising winds conspire,<br/>
        And near our palace roll the flood of fire.<br/>
        ‘Haste, my dear father, (’t is no time to wait,)<br/>
        And load my shoulders with a willing freight.<br/>
        Whate’er befalls, your life shall be my care;<br/>
        One death, or one deliv’rance, we will share.<br/>
        My hand shall lead our little son; and you,<br/>
        My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.<br/>
        Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:<br/>
        Without the walls a ruin’d temple stands,<br/>
        To Ceres hallow’d once; a cypress nigh<br/>
        Shoots up her venerable head on high,<br/>
        By long religion kept; there bend your feet,<br/>
        And in divided parties let us meet.<br/>
        Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,<br/>
        Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:<br/>
        In me ’t is impious holy things to bear,<br/>
        Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,<br/>
        Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt<br/>
        Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.’<br/>
        Thus, ord’ring all that prudence could provide,<br/>
        I clothe my shoulders with a lion’s hide<br/>
        And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,<br/>
        The welcome load of my dear father take;<br/>
        While on my better hand Ascanius hung,<br/>
        And with unequal paces tripp’d along.<br/>
        Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray<br/>
        Thro’ ev’ry dark and ev’ry devious way.<br/>
        I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,<br/>
        The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,<br/>
        At ev’ry shadow now am seiz’d with fear,<br/>
        Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;<br/>
        Till, near the ruin’d gate arriv’d at last,<br/>
        Secure, and deeming all the danger past,<br/>
        A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.<br/>
        My father, looking thro’ the shades, with fear,<br/>
        Cried out: ‘Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;<br/>
        Their swords and shining armor I descry.’<br/>
        Some hostile god, for some unknown offense,<br/>
        Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;<br/>
        For, while thro’ winding ways I took my flight,<br/>
        And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,<br/>
        Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell<br/>
        If by her fatal destiny she fell,<br/>
        Or weary sate, or wander’d with affright;<br/>
        But she was lost for ever to my sight.<br/>
        I knew not, or reflected, till I meet<br/>
        My friends, at Ceres’ now deserted seat.<br/>
        We met: not one was wanting; only she<br/>
        Deceiv’d her friends, her son, and wretched me.
    </p>
    <p>
        “What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!<br/>
        Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!<br/>
        This was the fatal blow, that pain’d me more<br/>
        Than all I felt from ruin’d Troy before.<br/>
        Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<br/>
        Abandoning my now forgotten care,<br/>
        Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,<br/>
        My sire, my son, my country gods I left.<br/>
        In shining armor once again I sheathe<br/>
        My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<br/>
        Then headlong to the burning walls I run,<br/>
        And seek the danger I was forc’d to shun.<br/>
        I tread my former tracks; thro’ night explore<br/>
        Each passage, ev’ry street I cross’d before.<br/>
        All things were full of horror and affright,<br/>
        And dreadful ev’n the silence of the night.<br/>
        Then to my father’s house I make repair,<br/>
        With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<br/>
        Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<br/>
        The house was fill’d with foes, with flames beset.<br/>
        Driv’n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<br/>
        Thro’ air transported, to the roofs aspire.<br/>
        From thence to Priam’s palace I resort,<br/>
        And search the citadel and desart court.<br/>
        Then, unobserv’d, I pass by Juno’s church:<br/>
        A guard of Grecians had possess’d the porch;<br/>
        There Phœnix and Ulysses watch the prey,<br/>
        And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<br/>
        The spoils which they from ransack’d houses brought,<br/>
        And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<br/>
        The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<br/>
        The people’s treasure, and the pomp of priests.<br/>
        A rank of wretched youths, with pinion’d hands,<br/>
        And captive matrons, in long order stands.<br/>
        Then, with ungovern’d madness, I proclaim,<br/>
        Thro’ all the silent street, Creusa’s name:<br/>
        Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<br/>
        And sudden thro’ the shades of night appears—<br/>
        Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,<br/>
        But a pale specter, larger than the life.<br/>
        Aghast, astonish’d, and struck dumb with fear,<br/>
        I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen’d hair.<br/>
        Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<br/>
        ‘Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<br/>
        Desist, my much-lov’d lord, ’t indulge your pain;<br/>
        You bear no more than what the gods ordain.<br/>
        My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<br/>
        Nor he, the great controller of the sky.<br/>
        Long wand’ring ways for you the pow’rs decree;<br/>
        On land hard labors, and a length of sea.<br/>
        Then, after many painful years are past,<br/>
        On Latium’s happy shore you shall be cast,<br/>
        Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<br/>
        The flow’ry meadows, and the feeding folds.<br/>
        There end your toils; and there your fates provide<br/>
        A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<br/>
        There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<br/>
        And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<br/>
        Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<br/>
        Th’ imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;<br/>
        Or, stooping to the victor’s lust, disgrace<br/>
        My goddess mother, or my royal race.<br/>
        And now, farewell! The parent of the gods<br/>
        Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<br/>
        I trust our common issue to your care.’<br/>
        She said, and gliding pass’d unseen in air.<br/>
        I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<br/>
        And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<br/>
        And, thrice deceiv’d, on vain embraces hung.<br/>
        Light as an empty dream at break of day,<br/>
        Or as a blast of wind, she rush’d away.

        “Thus having pass’d the night in fruitless pain,<br/>
        I to my longing friends return again,<br/>
        Amaz’d th’ augmented number to behold,<br/>
        Of men and matrons mix’d, of young and old;<br/>
        A wretched exil’d crew together brought,<br/>
        With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<br/>
        Resolv’d, and willing, under my command,<br/>
        To run all hazards both of sea and land.<br/>
        The Morn began, from Ida, to display<br/>
        Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:<br/>
        Before the gates the Grecians took their post,<br/>
        And all pretense of late relief was lost.<br/>
        I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,<br/>
        And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.”
