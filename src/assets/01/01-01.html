        My intention being to acquire the <em>habitude</em> of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to
        distract my attention by attempting
        the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed
        to another, and so on, till
        I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisi- tion of some might facilitate the
        acquisition of certain others, I ar- rang'd them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it
        tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be
        kept up, and guard
        maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and
        the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd.
        Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain
        knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering
        that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to
        break a habit
        I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only
        made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second
        place. This and the next. Order, I expected would allow me more
        time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my
        endeavors to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from
        my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and
        Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily
        examination would be necessary, I contrived
        the following method for conducting that examination.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the
        virtues. I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each
        column with a letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking
        the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues,
        on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a
        little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been
        committed respecting that virtue upon that day.
    </p>
    <img alt="Form of the Pages" src="../articleImgs/benFranklinBook.png"/>
    <p>
        I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively.
        Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance,
        leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day.
        Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line,
        marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much
        strengthen'd, and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture ex-tending my attention to include the next, and
        for the following week
        keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go
        thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to
        weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach
        and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having
        accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, 1 hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on
        my pages the progress
        I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I
        should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.
    </p>
    <p>
        This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's
        <em>Cato</em>:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Here will I hold. If there's a power above us (And that there is, all nature cries aloud Thro' all her works),
        He must delight in virtue; And that which he delights in must be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
        Another from Cicero,
    </p>
    <p>
        "O vitae Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque viti-orum! Unus dies, bene et ex przccptis tuis
        actus, pcccanti immortalitatiest anteponendus."
    </p>
    <p>
        Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or
        virtue:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and
        honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace."
        iii. 16, 17.
    </p>
    <p>
        And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for
        obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my
        tables of examination, for daily use.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            "O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest
            interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy
            other children as the only return in my power for thy continual
            favors to me."
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's
        Poems, viz.:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!
        O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself! Save me from folly, vanity, and vice. From every low pursuit; and
        fill my soul With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;
        Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!"
    </p>
    <p>
        The precept of Order requiring that every part of my business
        should have its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd
        the following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of
        a natural day:
    </p>
    <img alt="Ben Franklin Schedule" src="../articleImgs/benFranklinSchedule.png"/>
    <p>
        I enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and
        continu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time. I was surpris'd
        to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish.
        To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of
        old faults to make room for new
        ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a
        memorandum book, on which
        the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on
        those lines I mark'd my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks
        I could easily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went
        thro' one course only in a year, and afterward only one in several
        years, till at length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voy-ages and business abroad, with a
        multiplicity of affairs that inter-fered; but I always carried my little book with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        My scheme of Order gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's
        business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it
        was not possible to be exactly observed by a master,
        who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business
        at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to
        acquire. I had not been
        early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience
        attending want of method.
        This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my
        faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that
        I was almost ready
        to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying
        an ax of a smith, my
        neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it
        bright for him if he would
        turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of
        the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and
        then from the wheel
        to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as
        it was, without farther grinding. "No," said the smith, "turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as
        yet, it is only
        speckled." "Yes," said the man, "but I think I like a speckled ax
        best." And I believe this may have been the case with many, who,
        having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad
        habits in other points of
        vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that "a
        speckled ax was best"; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that
        such extream nicety
        as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which,
        if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character
        might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and
        hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself,
        to keep his friends in countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
        In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel
        very sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection
        I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a
        happier man than I otherwise
        should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect
        writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach
        the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by
        the endeavor, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little
        artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant
        felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the remainder is
        in the hand of Providence;
        but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more
        resignation. To Temperance
        he ascribes his long continued health, and what is still left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and
        Frugality, the early
        easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with
        all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained
        for him some degree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country,
        and the honorable
        employs it conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of
        the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfect state he was able
        to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness
        in conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and
        agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore,
        that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the
        benefit.
