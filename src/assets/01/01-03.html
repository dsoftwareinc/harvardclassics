        Now friendship may be thus defined: a complete accord on all
        subjects human and divine, joined with mutual good will and
        affection. And with the exception of wisdom, I am inclined to think
        nothing better than this has been given to man by the immortal gods.
        There are people who give the palm to riches or to good health, or to power and office, many even to sensual
        pleasures. This last is the ideal of brute beasts; and of the others we may say that they are
        frail and uncertain, and def)end less on our own prudence than on the caprice of fortune. Then there are those
        who find the "chief good"
        in virtue. Well, that is a noble doctrine. But the very virtue they
        talk of is the parent and preserver of friendship, and without it friendship cannot possibly exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let us, I repeat, use the word virtue in the ordinary acceptation and
        meaning of the term, and do not let us define it in high-flown language. Let us account as good the persons
        usually considered so, such
        as Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio, and Philus. Such men as these are good enough for everyday life; and we need
        not trouble ourselves about those ideal characters which are nowhere to be met with.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, between men like these the advantages of friendship are almost more than I can say. To begin with, how can
        life be worth
        living, to use the words of Ennius, which lacks that repose which is to be found in the mutual good will of a
        friend? What can be more
        delightful than to have some one to whom you can say everything
        with the same absolute confidence as to yourself? Is not prosperity
        robbed of half its value if you have no one to share your joy? On
        the other hand, misfortunes would be hard to bear if there were not some one to feel them even more acutely than
        yourself. In a word,
        other objects of ambition serve for particular ends—riches for use, power for securing homage, office for
        reputation, pleasure for enjoyment,
        health for freedom from pain and the full use of the functions
        of the body. But friendship embraces innumerable advantages. Turn
        which way you please, you will find it at hand. It is everywhere; and
        yet never out of place, never unwelcome. Fire and water themselves,
        to use a common expression, are not of more universal use than
        friendship. I am not now speaking of the common or modified
        form of it, though even that is a source of pleasure and profit, but of
        that true and complete friendship which existed between the select few who are known to fame. Such friendship
        enhances prosperity,
        and reheves adversity of its burden by halving and sharing it.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. And great and numerous as are the blessings of friendship, this
        certainly is the sovereign one, that it gives us bright hopes for the
        future and forbids weakness and despair. In the face of a true friend
        a man sees as it were a second self. So that where his friend is he is;
        if his friend be rich, he is not poor; though he be weak, his friend's strength is his; and in his friend's hfe
        he enjoys a second life after
        his own is finished. This last is perhaps the most difficult to conceive. But such is the effect of the respect,
        the loving remembrance, and
        the regret of friends which follow us to the grave. While they take
        the sting out of death, they add a glory to the life of the survivors. Nay, if you eliminate from nature the tie
        of affection, there will be an end of house and city, nor will so much as the cultivation of the
        soil be left. If you don't see the virtue of friendship and harmony,
        you may learn it by observing the effects of quarrels and feuds. Was
        any family ever so well established, any State so firmly settled, as to be beyond the reach of utter destruction
        from animosities and factions? This may teach you the immense advantage of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
        They say that a certain philosopher of Agrigentum, in a Greek
        poem, pronounced with the authority of an oracle the doctrine that whatever in nattire and the universe was
        unchangeable was so in virtue of the binding force of friendship; whatever was changeable was so by the solvent
        power of discord. And indeed this is a truth which everybody understands and practically attests by experience.
        For if any marked instance of loyal friendship in confronting or sharing danger comes to light, every one
        applauds it to the echo. What cheers there were, for instance, all over the theatre at a passage
        in the new play of my friend and guest Pacuvius; where, the king
        not knowing which of the two was Orestes, Pylades declared himself
        to be Orestes, that he might die in his stead, while the real Orestes kept on asserting that it was he. The
        audience rose en masse and
        clapped their hands. And this was at an incident in fiction: what
        would they have done, must we suppose, if it had been in real life?
        You can easily see what a natural feeling it is, when men who would
        not have had the resolution to act thus themselves, shewed how right
        they thought it in another.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think I have any more to say about friendship. If there
        is any more, and I have no doubt there is much, you must, if you care to do so, consult those who profess to
        discuss such
        matters.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Fanntus</em>. We would rather apply to you. Yet I have often consulted
        such persons, and have heard what they had to say with a certain satisfaction. But in your discourse one somehow
        feels that there
        is a different strain.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Sccevola</em>. You would have said that still more, Fannius, if you
        had been present the other day in Scipio's pleasure-grounds when we had the discussion about the State. How
        splendidly he stood up
        for justice against Philus's elaborate speech!
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Fannius</em>. Ah! it was naturally easy for the justest of men to stand
        up for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Scavola</em>. Well, then, what about friendship? Who could discourse on it more easily than the man whose
        chief glory is a friendship
        maintained with the most absolute fidelity, constancy, and integrity?
    </p>
    <p>
        8. <em>Laelius</em>. Now you are really using force. It makes no difference what kind of force you use: force it
        is. For it is neither easy nor right to refuse a wish of my sons-in-law, particularly when the wish
        is a creditable one in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, then, it has very often occurred to me when thinking about
        friendship, that the chief point to be considered was this: is it weakness
        and want of means that make friendship desired ? I mean, is its object an interchange of good offices, so that
        each may give that in which he is strong, and receive that in which he is weak? Or is it not rather true that,
        although this is an advantage naturally belonging
        to friendship, yet its original cause is quite other, prior in time, more noble in character, and springing more
        directly from our nature
        itself? The Latin word for friendship
        —
        amicitia—is derived from
        that for love
        —
        amor; and love is certainly the prime mover in contracting
        mutual affection. For as to material advantages, it often happens that those are obtained even by men who are
        courted by a mere show of friendship and treated with respect from interested motives. But friendship by its
        nature admits of no feigning, no pretence: as far as it goes it is both genuine and spontaneous. Therefore
        I gather that friendship springs from a natural impulse rather than a wish for help: from an inclination of the
        heart, combined with a
        certain instinctive feeling of love, rather than from a deliberate
        calculation of the material advantage it was likely to confer. The
        strength of this feeling you may notice in certain animals. They show
        such love to their offspring for a certain period, and are so beloved
        by them, that they clearly have a share in this natural, instinctive
        affection. But of course it is more evident in the case of man: first, in the natural affection between children
        and their parents, an
        affection which only shocking wickedness can sunder; and next,
        when the passion of love has attained to a like strength—on our
        finding, that is, some one person with whose character and nature we
        are in full sympathy, because we think that we perceive in him what
        I may call the beacon-light of virtue. For nothing inspires love,
        nothing conciliates affection, like virtue. Why, in a certain sense we
        may be said to feel affection even for men we have never seen, owing
        to their honesty and virtue. Who, for instance, fails to dwell on the memory of Gaius Fabricius and Manius
        Curius with some affection and warmth of feeling, though he has never seen them? Or who
        but loathes Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius Cassius, Spurius Melius? We have fought for empire in Italy with two
        great generals, Pyrrhus
        and Hannibal. For the former, owing to his probity, we entertain no great feelings of enmity : the latter, owing
        to his cruelty, our country
        has detested and always will detest.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. Now, if the attraction of probity is so great that we can love it not only in those whom we have never seen,
        but, what is more,
        actually in an enemy, we need not be surprised if men's affections are roused when they fancy that they have
        seen virtue and goodness
        in those with whom a close intimacy is possible. I do not deny
        that affection is strengthened by the actual receipt of benefits, as well
        as by the perception of a wish to render service, combined with a
        closer intercourse. When these are added to the original impulse
        of the heart, to which I have alluded, a quite surprising warmth of
        feeling springs up. And if any one thinks that this comes from a sense of weakness, that each may have some one
        to help him to
        his particular need, all I can say is that, when he maintains it to be
        born of want and poverty, he allows to friendship an origin very
        base, and a pedigree, if I may be allowed the expression, far from
        noble. If this had been the case, a man's inclination to friendship
        would be exactly in proportion to his low opinion of his own resources. Whereas the truth is quite the other
        way. For when a man's
        confidence in himself is greatest, when he is so fortified by virtue and
        wisdom as to want nothing and to feel absolutely self-dependent, it is then that he is most conspicuous for
        seeking out and keeping up
        friendships. Did Africanus, for example, want anything of me?
        Not the least in the world! Neither did I of him. In my case it was
        an admiration of his virtue, in his an opinion, maybe, which he
        entertained of my character, that caused our affection. Closer intimacy added to the warmth of our feelings. But
        though many great
        material advantages did ensue, they were not the source from
        which our affection proceeded. For as we are not beneficent and
        liberal with any view of extorting gratitude, and do not regard an act of kindness as an investment, but follow
        a natural inclination to
        liberality; so we look on friendship as worth trying for, not because
        we are attracted to it by the expectation of ulterior gain, but in the conviction that what it has to give us is
        from first to last included
        in the feeling itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Far different is the view of those who, like brute beasts, refer everything to sensual pleasure. And no wonder.
        Men who have degraded
        all their powers of thought to an object so mean and contemptible can of course raise their eyes to nothing
        lofty, to nothing grand and
        divine. Such persons indeed let us leave out of the present question.
        And let us accept the doctrine that the sensation of love and the warmth of inclination have their origin in a
        spontaneous feeling
        which arises directly the presence of probity is indicated. When once men have conceived the inclination, they
        of course try to attach themselves to the object of it, and move themselves nearer and nearer
        to him. Their aim is that they may be on the same footing and the same level in regard to affection, and be more
        inclined to do a good
        service than to ask a return, and that there should be this noble
        rivalry between them. Thus both truths will be established. We
        shall get the most important material advantages from friendship;
        and its origin from a natural impulse rather than from a sense of need will be at once more dignified and more
        in accordance with
        fact. For if it were true that its material advantages cemented
        friendship, it would be equally true that any change in them would
        dissolve it. But nature being incapable of change, it follows that genuine friendships are eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
        So much for the origin of friendship. But perhaps you would not
        care to hear any more.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Fannius</em>. Nay, pray go on; let us have the rest, Laclius. I take on myself to speak for my friend here
        as his senior.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Sccevola</em>. Quite right! Therefore, pray let us hear.
    </p>
    <p>
        10. <em>Laelius</em>. Well, then, my good friends, listen to some conversations
        about friendship which very frequently passed between Scipio
        and myself. I must begin by telling you, however, that he used to say that the most difficult thing in the world
        was for a friendship to remain unimpaired to the end of life. So many things might intervene: conflicting
        interests; differences of opinion in politics; frequent changes in character, owing sometimes to misfortunes,
        sometimes
        to advancing years. He used to illustrate these facts from the
        analogy of boyhood, since the warmest affections between boys are
        often laid aside with the boyish toga; and even if they did manage
        to keep them up to adolescence, they were sometimes broken by a rivalry in courtship, or for some other
        advantage to which their mutual claims were not compatible. Even if the friendship was
        prolonged beyond that time, yet it frequently received a rude shock
        should the two happen to be competitors for office. For while the most fatal blow to friendship in the majority
        of cases was the lust of gold, in the case of the best men it was a rivalry for office and
        reputation, by which it had often happened that the most violent enmity had arisen between the closest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, wide breaches and, for the most part, justifiable ones were
        caused by an immoral request being made of friends, to pander to a man's unholy desires or to assist him in
        inflicting a wrong. A
        refusal, though perfectly right, is attacked by those to whom they
        refuse compliance as a violation of the laws of friendship. Now the people who have no scruples as to the
        requests they make to their
        friends, thereby allow that they are ready to have no scruples as to what they will do jor their friends; and it
        is the recriminations of such people which commonly not only quench friendships, but give
        rise to lasting enmities. "In fact," he used to say, "these fatalities overhang friendship in such numbers that
        it requires not only wisdom but good luck also to escape them all."
    </p>
    <p>
        11. With these premises, then, let us first, if you please, examine
        the question—how far ought personal feeling to go in friendship?
        For instance: suppose Coriolanus to have had friends, ought they
        to have joined him in invading his country? Again, in the case of Vecellinus or Spurius Mselius, ought their
        friends to have assisted them in their attempt to estabUsh a tyranny ? Take two instances of
        either line of conduct. When Tiberius Gracchus attempted his revolutionary measures he was deserted, as we saw,
        by Quintus
        Tubero and the friends of his own standing. On the other hand,
        a friend of your own family, Scsevola, Gaius Blossius of Cumae,
        took a different course. I was acting as assessor to the consuls Lacnas and Rupilius to try the conspirators,
        and Blossius pleaded
        for my pardon on the ground that his regard for Tiberius Gracchus
        had been so high that he looked upon his wishes as law. "Even if he
        had wished you to set fire to the Capitol?" said I. "That is a thing,"
        he replied, "that he never would have wished." "Ah, but if he had
        wished it?" said I. "I would have obeyed." The wickedness of such a speech needs no comment. And in point of
        fact he was as good and
        better than his word; for he did not wait for orders in the audacious
        proceedings of Tiberius Gracchus, but was the head and front of
        them, and was a leader rather than an abettor of his madness.
        The result of his infatuation was that he fled to Asia, terrified by the
        special commission appointed to try him, joined the enemies of his country, and paid a penalty to the republic
        as heavy as it was
        deserved. I conclude, then, that the plea of having acted in the
        interests of a friend is not a valid excuse for a wrong action. For,
        seeing that a belief in a man's virtue is the original cause of friendship,
        friendship can hardly remain if virtue be abandoned. But if we decide it to be right to grant our friends
        whatever they wish,
        and to ask them for whatever we wish, perfect wisdom must be
        assumed on both sides if no mischief is to happen. But we cannot assume this perfect wisdom; for we are speaking
        only of such friends
        as are ordinarily to be met with, whether we have actually seen them or have been told about them—men, that is
        to say, of everyday
        life. I must quote some examples of such persons, taking care to
        select such as approach nearest to our standard of wisdom. We
        read, for instance, that Papus AEmilius was a close friend of Gaius
        Luscinus. History tells us that they were twice consuls together,
        and colleagues in the censorship. Again, it is on record that Manius
        Curius and Tiberius Coruncanius were on the most intimate terms
        with them and with each other. Now, we cannot even suspect that any one of these men ever asked of his friend
        anything that militated
        against his honour or his oath or the interests of the republic. In
        the case of such men as these there is no pwint in saying that one of them would not have obtained such a
        request if he had made it;
        for they were men of the most scrupulous piety, and the making
        of such a request would involve a breach of religious obligation no
        less than the granting it. However, it is quite true that Gaius Carbo
        and Gaius Cato did follow Tiberius Gracchus; and though his brother Gaius Gracchus did not do so at the time, he
        is now the most
        eager of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
        12. We may then lay down this rule of friendship
        —
        neither ask nor
        consent to do what is wrong. For the plea "for friendship's sake"
        is a discreditable one, and not to be admitted for a moment. This rule holds good for all wrong-doing, but more
        especially in such as involves disloyalty to the republic. For things have come to such a point with us, my dear
        Fannius and Scaevola, that we are bound to look somewhat far ahead to what is likely to happen to the republic.
        The constitution, as known to our ancestors, has already swerved
        somewhat from the regular course and the lines marked out for it. Tiberius Gracchus made an attempt to obtain
        the power of a king,
        or, I might rather say, enjoyed that power for a few months. Had
        the Roman people ever heard or seen the like before? What the
        friends and connexions that followed him, even after his death,
        have succeeded in doing in the case of Publius Scipio I cannot
        describe without tears. As for Carbo, thanks to the punishment
        recently inflicted on Tiberius Gracchus, we have by hook or by
        crook managed to hold out against his attacks. But what to expect
        of the tribuneship of Gaius Gracchus I do not like to forecast. One
        thing leads to another; and once set going, the downward course proceeds with ever-increasing velocity. There is
        the case of the
        ballot: what a blow was inflicted first by the lex Gabinia, and two
        years afterwards by the lex Cassia! I seem already to see the people
        estranged from the Senate, and the most important affairs at the mercy of the multitude. For you may be sure
        that more people
        will learn how to set such things in motion than how to stop them.
        What is the point of these remarks? This: no one ever makes any
        attempt of this sort without friends to help him. We must therefore impress upon good men that, should they
        become inevitably involved
        in friendships with men of this kind, they ought not to consider
        themselves under any obligation to stand by friends who are disloyal to the republic. Bad men must have the fear
        of punishment before
        their eyes: a punishment not less severe for those who follow than
        for those who lead others to crime. Who was more famous and
        powerful in Greece than Themistocles? At the head of the army
        in the Persian war he had freed Greece; he owed his exile to personal
        envy: but he did not submit to the wrong done him by his ungrateful
        country as he ought to have done. He acted as Coriolanus had
        acted among us twenty years before. But no one was found to help
        them in their attacks upon their fatherland. Both of them accordingly committed suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
        We conclude, then, not only that no such confederation of evilly
        disposed men must be allowed to shelter itself under the plea of
        friendship, but that, on the contrary, it must be visited with the
        severest punishment, lest the idea should prevail that fidelity to a
        friend justifies even making war upon one's country. And this is a
        case which I am inclined to think, considering how things are beginning to go, will sooner or later arise. And I
        care quite as much
        what the state of the constitution will be after my death as what it is now.
    </p>
    <p>
        13. Let this, then, be laid down as the first law of friendship, that we should ask from friends, and do for
        friends, only what is good.
        But do not let us wait to be asked either: let there be ever an eager
        readiness, and an absence of hesitation. Let us have the courage
        to give advice with candour. In friendship, let the influence of
        friends who give good advice be paramount; and let this influence be used to enforce advice not only in
        plain-spoken terms, but
        sometimes, if the case demands it, with sharpness; and when so used,
        let it be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I give you these rules because I believe that some wonderful
        opinions are entertained by certain persons who have, I am told, a reputation for wisdom in Greece. There is
        nothing in the world, by
        the way, beyond the reach of their sophistry. Well, some of them
        teach that we should avoid very close friendships, for fear that one man should have to endure the anxieties of
        several. Each man, say
        they, has enough and to spare on his own hands; it is too bad to be
        involved in the cares of other people. The wisest course is to hold
        the reins of friendship as loose as possible; you can then tighten or
        slacken them at your will. For the first condition of a happy life is freedom from care, which no one's mind can
        enjoy if it has to travail, so to speak, for others besides itself. Another sect, I am told, gives vent to
        opinions still less generous. I briefly touched on this subject
        just now. They affirm that friendships should be sought solely for the sake of the assistance they give, and not
        at all from motives of
        feeling and affection; and that therefore just in proportion as a man's
        power and means of support are lowest, he is most eager to gain
        friendships: thence it comes that weak women seek the support of
        friendship more than men, the poor more than the rich, the unfortunate rather than those esteemed prosperous.
        What noble philosophy!
        You might just as well take the sun out of the sky as friendship
        from life; for the immortal gods have given us nothing better or more delightful.

        But let us examine the two doctrines. What is the value of this "freedom from care"? It is very tempting at
        first sight, but in practice it has in many cases to be put on one side. For there is no
        business and no course of action demanded from us by our honour
        which you can consistently decline, or lay aside when begun, from a mere wish to escape from anxiety. Nay, if we
        wish to avoid anxiety we must avoid virtue itself, which necessarily involves some anxious
        thoughts in showing its loathing and abhorrence for the qualities
        which are opposite to itself—as kindness for ill nature, self-control for licentiousness, courage for cowardice.
        Thus you may notice that it is the just who are most pained at injustice, the brave at cowardly actions, the
        temperate at depravity. It is then characteristic of a rightly ordered mind to be pleased at what is good and
        grieved
        at the reverse. Seeing then that the wise are not exempt from the
        heartache (which must be the case unless we suppose all human
        nature rooted out of their hearts), why should we banish friendship
        from our lives, for fear of being involved by it in some amount of
        distress? If you take away emotion, what difference remains I don't say between a man and a beast, but between a
        man and a stone or a log of wood, or anything else of that kind?

        Neither should we give any weight to the doctrine that virtue is something rigid and unyielding as iron. In
        point of fact it is in regard to friendship, as in so many other things, so supple and
        sensitive that it expands, so to speak, at a friend's good fortune, contracts
        at his misfortunes. We conclude then that mental pain which
        we must often encounter on a friend's account is not of sufficient consequence to banish friendship from our
        life, any more than it
        is true that the cardinal virtues are to be dispensed with because they
        involve certain anxieties and distresses.
