        POLYEUCTE. NEARCHUS
    </p>
    <p>
        Nearchus. <br/>
        SHALL woman’s dream of terror hurl the dart?<br/>
        Oh, feeble weapon ’gainst so great a heart!<br/>
        Must courage proved a thousand times in arms<br/>
        Bow to a peril forged by vain alarms?
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. I know that dreams are born to fade away,<br/>
        And melt in air before the light of day;<br/>
        I know that misty vapours of the night<br/>
        Dissolve and fly before the morning bright.<br/>
        The dream is naught—but the dear dreamer—all!<br/>
        She has my soul, Nearchus, fast in thrall;<br/>
        Who holds the marriage torch—august, divine,<br/>
        Bids me to her sweet voice my will resign.<br/>
        She fears my death—tho’ baseless this her fright,<br/>
        Pauline is wrung with fear—by day—by night;<br/>
        My road to duty hampered by her fears,<br/>
        How can I go when all undried her tears?<br/>
        Her terror I disown—and all alarms,<br/>
        Yet pity holds me in her loving arms:<br/>
        No bolts or bars imprison,—yet her sighs<br/>
        My fetters are—my conquerors, her eyes!<br/>
        Say, kind Nearchus, is the cause you press<br/>
        Such as to make me deaf to her distress?<br/>
        The bonds I slacken I would not unloose—<br/>
        Nothing I yield—yet grant a timely truce.
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. How grant you know not what? Are you assured<br/>
        Of constancy?—as one who has endured?<br/>
        God claims your soul for Him!—Now! Now! To-day!<br/>
        The fruit to-morrow yields—oh, who shall say?<br/>
        Our God is just, but do His grace and power<br/>
        Descend on recreants with equal shower?<br/>
        On darkened souls His flame of light He turns,<br/>
        Yet flame neglected soon but faintly burns,<br/>
        And dying embers fade to ashes cold<br/>
        If we the heart His spirit wooes withhold.<br/>
        Great Heaven retains the fire no longer sought,<br/>
        While ashes turn to dust, and dust to naught.<br/>
        His holy baptism He bids thee seek,—<br/>
        Neglect the call, and the desire grows weak.<br/>
        Ah! whilst from woman’s breast thou heedst the sighs,<br/>
        The flame first flickers, then, untended—dies!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. You know me ill,—’tis mine, that holy fire,<br/>
        Fed, not extinguished, by unslaked desire<br/>
        Her tears—I view them with a lover’s eye;<br/>
        And yet your Christ is mine—a Christian I!<br/>
        The healing, cleansing flood o’er me shall flow,<br/>
        I would efface the stain from birth I owe;<br/>
        I would be pure—my sealed eyes would see!<br/>
        The birthright Adam lost restored to me—<br/>
        This, this, the unfading crown! For this I yearn,<br/>
        For that exhaustless fount I thirst, I burn.<br/>
        Then, since my heart is true, Nearchus, say—<br/>
        Shall I not grant to pity this delay?
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. So doth the ghostly foe our souls abuse,<br/>
        And all beyond his force he gains by ruse;<br/>
        He hates the purpose fast he cannot foil,—<br/>
        Then he retreats—retreats but to recoil!<br/>
        In endless barricade obstruction piles,—<br/>
        To-day ’tis tears impede, to-morrow—smiles!<br/>
        And this poor dream—his coinage of the night—<br/>
        Gives place to other lures, all falsely bright:<br/>
        All tricks he knows and uses—threats and prayers—<br/>
        Attacks in parley—as the Parthian dares.<br/>
        In chain unheeded weakest link must fail,<br/>
        So fortress yet unwon he’ll mount and scale.<br/>
        O break his bonds! Let feeble woman weep!<br/>
        The heart that God has touched ’tis God must keep!<br/>
        Who looks behind to dally with his choice<br/>
        When Heaven demands—obeys another voice!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Who loves thy Christ—say, must he love no other?
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. He may—he must! ’Tis Christ says, “Love thy brother,’<br/>
        Yet on the altar of the Heavenly King<br/>
        No rival place, no alien incense fling!<br/>
        Through Him—by Him—for him—all goodness know!<br/>
        ’Tis from the source alone each stream must flow.<br/>
        To please Him, wife, and wealth, and rank, and state<br/>
        Must be forsaken—strait the heavenly gate.<br/>
        Poor silly sheep! afar you err and stray<br/>
        From Him who is The Life, The Truth, The Way!<br/>
        My grief chokes utterance! I see your fate,<br/>
        As round the fold the hungry wolves of hate<br/>
        Closer and fiercer rage: from sword and flame<br/>
        One shelter for His flock—one only Name!<br/>
        The Cross alone our victor over fears,<br/>
        Not this thy strength,—thy plea—a woman’s tears!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. I know thy heart! It is mine own—the tear<br/>
        My pity drops hath ne’er a taint of fear!<br/>
        Who dreads not torture, yet—to give relief<br/>
        To her he loves, perforce must ease her grief!<br/>
        If Heaven should claim my life, my death, my all,—<br/>
        Then Heaven will give the strength to heed the call.<br/>
        The shepherd guides me surely to the fold,<br/>
        There, safe with Him, ’tis He will make me bold!
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. Be bold! O come!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Yes, let thy faith be mine!<br/>
        There—at his feet—do I my life resign<br/>
        If but Pauline—my love—would give consent!<br/>
        Else heaven were hell, and home but banishment!
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. Come!—to return. Thrice welcome to her sight,<br/>
        To see thee safe will double her delight:<br/>
        As the pierced cloud unveils a brighter sun,—<br/>
        So is her joy enhanced—thy glory won!<br/>
        O come, they wait!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Appease her fear! Ah, this<br/>
        Alone will give her rest—her lover bliss.<br/>
        She comes!
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. Then fly!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. I cannot!
    </p>
    <p>
        NEAR. To deny<br/>
        Would yield thine enemy the victory!<br/>
        He loves to kill, and knows his deadliest dart<br/>
        Finds friend within the fort—thy traitor heart!
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter PAULINE and STRATONICE
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. I needs must go, Pauline! My love, good-bye!<br/>
        I go but to return—for thine am I!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Oh, why this haste to leave a loving wife?<br/>
        Doth honour call?—or fear’st thou for thy life?
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. For more, a thousandfold!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Great Gods above!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Thou hast my heart! Let this content thy love!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. You love and yet you leave me. What am I?<br/>
        Not mine to solve the dreary mystery!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. I love thee more than self—than life—than fame—<br/>
        But——
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. There is something that thou dar’st not name.<br/>
        Oh, on my knees I supplicate, I pray,<br/>
        Remove my darkness!—turn my night to day!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Oh, dreams are naught!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Yet, when they tell of thee,<br/>
        I needs must listen, for I love! Ah, me!
    </p>
    <p>
        POLY. Take courage, dear one, ’tis but for an hour,<br/>
        Thy love must draw me back, for love hath power<br/>
        O’er all in earth and heaven. My soul’s delight,<br/>
        I can no more! My only safety-flight! [Exeunt POLYEUCTE and NEARCHUS.]
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Yes, go, despise my prayer—my agony;<br/>
        Go, ruthless—meet thy fate—forewarned by me;<br/>
        Chase thy pursuer, herald thine own doom;<br/>
        Go, kiss the murderer’s hand, and hail the tomb!<br/>
        Ah, Stratonice! for our boasted power<br/>
        As sovereigns o’er man’s heart! Poor regents of an hour!<br/>
        Faint, helpless, moonbeam-light was all I gave,<br/>
        The sun breaks forth—his queen becomes his slave!<br/>
        Wooed? Yes; as other queens I held my court—<br/>
        Won—but to lose my crown, and be the sport<br/>
        Of proud, absorbing and imperious man!
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Ah, man does what he wills—we, what we can;<br/>
        He loves thee, lady!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Love should mate with trusts;<br/>
        He leaves me!
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Lady, ’tis because he must!<br/>
        He loves thee with a love will never die,<br/>
        Then, if he leave thee, reason not the why:<br/>
        Give him thy trust! Oh, thou shalt have reward,<br/>
        For thee he hides the secret! Let him guard<br/>
        Thy life beloved—in fullest liberty.<br/>
        The wife who wholly trusts alone in free!<br/>
        One heart for thee and him—one purpose sure,<br/>
        Yet this heart beats to dare—and to endure.<br/>
        The wife’s true heart must o’er the peril sigh<br/>
        Which meets his heart moved but to purpose high;<br/>
        Thy pain his pain, but not his terror thine:<br/>
        He is Armenian, thou of Roman line.<br/>
        We, of Armenia, mock thy dreams to scorn,<br/>
        For they are born of night, as truth of morn;<br/>
        While Romans hold that dreams are heaven-sent,<br/>
        And spring from Jove for man’s admonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Though this thy faith—if thou my dream shouldst hear—<br/>
        My grief must needs be thine, thy fear my fear,<br/>
        And, that the horror thou may’st fully prove,<br/>
        Know that I—his dear wife—did once another love!<br/>
        Nay, start not, shrink not, ’tis no tale of shame,<br/>
        For though in other years the heavenly flame<br/>
        Descended, kindled, scorched—it left me pure—<br/>
        With courage to resign—with strength to endure.<br/>
        He touched my heart, but never stained the soul<br/>
        That gained this hardest conquest—self-control.<br/>
        At Rome—where I was born—a soldier’s eye<br/>
        Marked this poor face, from which must Polyeucte fly;<br/>
        Severus was his name:—Ah! memory<br/>
        May spare love linked with death a tear, a sigh!
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Say, is it he who, at the risk of life,<br/>
        Saved Decius from his foes and endless strife?<br/>
        Who, dying, dealt to Persia stroke of death,<br/>
        And shouted ‘Victory!’ with his latest breath?<br/>
        His whitening bones, amid the nameless brave,<br/>
        Lie still unfound, unknown, without a grave;<br/>
        Unburied lies his dust amid the slain,<br/>
        While Decius rears an empty urn in vain!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Alas! ’tis he; all Rome attests his worth,—<br/>
        Hide not his memory, kindly Mother Earth!<br/>
        ’Tis but his memory that I adore—<br/>
        The past is past—and I can say no more.<br/>
        All gifts save one had he—yes, Fortune held her hand,<br/>
        And I, as Fortune’s slave, obeyed my sire’s command.
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Ah! I must wish that love the day had won!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Which duty lost—then had I been undone;<br/>
        Though duty gave, yet duty healed, my pain;<br/>
        Yet say not that my love was weak or vain!<br/>
        Our tears fell fast, yet ne’er bore our distress<br/>
        The fatal fruit of strife and bitterness.<br/>
        Then, then, I left my hero, hope and Rome,<br/>
        And, far from him, I found another home;<br/>
        While he, in his despair, sought sure relief<br/>
        In death, the only end to life’s long grief!<br/>
        You know the rest:—you know that Polyeucte’s eye<br/>
        Was caught,—his fancy pleased; his wife am I.<br/>
        Once more by counsel of my father led,<br/>
        To Armenia’s greatest noble am I wed;<br/>
        Ambition, prudence, policy his guide<br/>
        Yet only duty made Pauline his bride;<br/>
        Love might have bound me to Severus’ heart,<br/>
        Had duty not enforced a sterner part.<br/>
        Yes, let these fears attest, all trembling for his life,<br/>
        That I am his for aye—his faithful, loving wife.
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Thy new love true and tender as the old:—<br/>
        But this thy dream? No more thy tale withhold!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Last night I saw Severus: but his eye<br/>
        With anger blazed; his port was proud and high,<br/>
        No suppliant he—no feeble, formless shade,<br/>
        With dim, averted eye; no sword had made<br/>
        My hero lifeless ghost. Nor wound, nor scar<br/>
        Marked death his only conqueror in war.<br/>
        Nor spoil of death, nor memory’s child was he,<br/>
        His mien triumphant, full of majesty!<br/>
        So might victorious Caesar near his home<br/>
        To claim the key to every heart in Rome!<br/>
        He spoke: in nameless awe I heard his voice,—<br/>
        ‘Give love, that is my due, to him—thy choice,—<br/>
        But know, oh faithless one, ere day expires,<br/>
        All vain these tears for him thy heart desires!’<br/>
        Anon a Christian band (an impious horde),<br/>
        With shameful cross in hand, attest his word;<br/>
        They vouch Severus’ truth—and, to complete<br/>
        My doom, hurl Polyeucte beneath his feet!<br/>
        I cried, ‘O father, timely succour bear!’<br/>
        He heard, he came, my grief was now despair!<br/>
        He drew his dagger—plunged it in the breast<br/>
        Of him, my husband, late his honoured guest!<br/>
        Relief came but from agony supreme—<br/>
        I shrieked—I writhed—I woke—it was a dream!<br/>
        And yet my dream is true!
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. ’Tis true your dream is sad,<br/>
        But now you are awake, ’tis but a dream you had!<br/>
        For horror’s prey in darkness of the night<br/>
        Is but our reason’s sport in morning light.<br/>
        How can you dread a shade? How a fond father fear,<br/>
        Who as a son regards the man you hold so dear?<br/>
        To phantom of the night no credence yield;<br/>
        For him and you he chose thy strength and shield.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. You say his words: at all my fears he smiles,<br/>
        But I must dread these Christians and their wiles!<br/>
        I dread their vengeance, wreaked upon my lord,<br/>
        For Christian blood my father has outpoured!
    </p>
    <p>
        STRAT. Their sect is impious, mad, absurd and vain,<br/>
        Their rites repulsive, as their cult profane.<br/>
        Deride their altar, their weak frenzy ban,<br/>
        Yet do they war with gods and not with man!<br/>
        Relentless wills our law that they must die:<br/>
        Their joy—endurance; death—their ecstasy;<br/>
        Judged—by decree, the foes of human race,<br/>
        Meekly their heads they bow—to court disgrace!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. My father comes—oh, peace!
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter FELIX and ALBIN
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Nay, peace is flown!<br/>
        Thy dream begets dull fears, till now unknown;<br/>
        In part this dream is true, and for the rest——
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. By what new fear, say, is thy heart opprest?
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Severus lives!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Ah! this no cause for fear!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. At Decius’ court, he, held in honour dear,<br/>
        Risked life to save his Emperor from his foes,<br/>
        ’Tis to his saviour Decius honour shows!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Thus fickle Fortune bows her head to fate,<br/>
        And pays the honour due, though all too late!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. He comes! Is near——
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. The gods——
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Do all things well.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. My dream fulfilled! But how? O father, tell!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Let Albin speak, who saw him face to face<br/>
        With tribe of courtiers; all to him give place;<br/>
        Unscathed in battle, all extol his fame,<br/>
        Unstained, undimmed, his glory, life and name!
    </p>
    <p>
        ALBIN. You know the issue of that glorious fight:<br/>
        The crowning glory his—who, in despite<br/>
        Of danger sore to life and liberty,<br/>
        Became a slave to set his Emperor free:<br/>
        Rome gave her honours to Severus’ shade,<br/>
        Whilst he, her ransomer, in a dungeon stayed.<br/>
        His death they mourned above ten thousand slain,<br/>
        While Persia held him—yes, their tears were vain,<br/>
        But not in vain his noble sacrifice!<br/>
        The king released him: Rome grudged not the price;<br/>
        No Persian bribe could tempt him from his home.<br/>
        When Decius cried—‘Fight once again for Rome!’<br/>
        Again he fights—he leads—all others hope resign;<br/>
        But from despair’s deep breast he plucks a star benign,<br/>
        This—hope’s fair fruit, contentment, plenty, ease,<br/>
        Brings joy from grief, to crown a lasting peace.<br/>
        The Emperor holds him as his dearest friend,<br/>
        And doth Severus to Armenia send—<br/>
        To offer up to Mars, and mighty Jove,<br/>
        ’Mid feast and sacrifice, his thanks and love.
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Ah, Fortune, turn thy wheel, else I misfortune meet!
    </p>
    <p>
        ALBIN. This news I learn’d from one of great Severus’ suite:<br/>
        Thence, swiftly here, the tale to tell I sped.
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. He who once vainly wooed, hopes now to wed.<br/>
        The sacrifice, the offering, all are feigned,<br/>
        All but the suit, which lightly I disdained.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Yes, this may be, for ah! he loved me well!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. What room for hope? Such wrath is child of hell.<br/>
        Before his righteous ire I shrink, I cower;<br/>
        Revenge I dread—and vengeance linked with power<br/>
        Unnerves me quite.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Fear not, his soul is great.
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. Thy comfort, oh my daughter, comes too late.<br/>
        The thought to crush me down, to turn my heart to stone,<br/>
        This, that I prized not worth for worth’s dear sake alone!<br/>
        Too well, Pauline, thou hast thy sire obeyed;<br/>
        Thy heart was fond, but duty love betrayed.<br/>
        How surely thy revolt had safety won!<br/>
        ’Tis thine obedience leaves us all undone.<br/>
        In thee, in thee alone, one hope remains,<br/>
        Love held him fast, relax not thou love’s chains.<br/>
        O Love, my sometime foe, forgive, be mine ally,<br/>
        And let the dart that slew now bring the remedy!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Forbid it, Heaven! One good yet mine,—my will,<br/>
        The dart that wounded has the power to kill.<br/>
        One lesson woman learns—her feebleness;<br/>
        Shame is the only grief without redress.<br/>
        The traitor heart shall still a prisoner be;<br/>
        For freedom were disgrace to thee and me!<br/>
        I will not see him!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. But one word! Be kind!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. I will not, for I love!—and love is blind.<br/>
        Before his kingly eye my soul to unveil<br/>
        Were shame and failure: and I will not fail:<br/>
        I will not see him!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. One word more—‘Obey!’<br/>
        Wouldst thou thy father and his weal betray?
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. I yield! Come woe!—come shame!—come every ill!<br/>
        My father thou!—and I thy daughter still!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. I know thee pure.
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. And pure I will remain,<br/>
        But, crushed and bruised, the flower no guilt shall stain.<br/>
        I fear the combat that I may not fly,—<br/>
        Hard-won the fight, and dear the victory.<br/>
        Here, love, my curse! Here, dearest friend, my foe!<br/>
        Yet will I arm me! Father, I would go<br/>
        To steel my heart—all weapons to embrace!
    </p>
    <p>
        FELIX. I too will go, the conqueror’s march to grace!<br/>
        Restore thy strength, ere yet it be too late,<br/>
        And know that in thy hands thou hold’st our fate!
    </p>
    <p>
        PAUL. Go, broken heart, to probe thy wound; cut deep and do not spare!<br/>
        Herself—the crowning sacrifice—the victim shall prepare!
